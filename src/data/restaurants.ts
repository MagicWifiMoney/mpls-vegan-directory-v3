    description: "The Herbivorous Butcher made history in 2016 as America's first vegan butcher shop, and it continues to revolutionize plant-based eating in Northeast Minneapolis. Run by sibling duo Aubry and Kale Walch, this isn't your typical vegan spot—it's a full-service deli where every \"meat\" and cheese is handcrafted in-house with the kind of attention to detail that would make any traditional butcher proud.\n\nThe Korean BBQ ribs are legendary for good reason—smoky, tender, and so convincing they've converted countless skeptics. Their Italian sausages snap with that perfect casing bite, while the pepperoni brings real heat and char to any pizza night. On the cheese side, their aged cheddar is sharp and crumbly, the havarti melts beautifully, and the pepperjack packs actual kick. Don't miss the deli counter where you can grab a ready-made sandwich—the Italian sub loaded with house-made salami and provolone is a Northeast favorite.\n\nThe shop itself has an industrial-meets-neighborhood vibe with brick walls, butcher paper displays, and that unmistakable smell of smoked tempeh. It's perfect for stocking your fridge with meal prep staples, grabbing lunch on the go, or picking up impressive host gifts. Weekend mornings see lines out the door, but it moves fast. This is vegan food that doesn't apologize—it just tastes damn good.",

Vegan toppings are called out clearly on the menu, and the kitchen takes cross-contamination seriously.\n\nThe flavor profiles lean into South Asian spice heritage: think tikka-inspired sauces, aromatic herbs, and boldly seasoned toppings that make the usual tomato-mozzarella paradigm feel boring by comparison. The Dinkytown Karma Bowl and customizable pies let you build something genuinely interesting rather than just picking \"the vegan option.\" Prices are student-budget friendly—you're getting fire-roasted artisan pizza at fast-food prices.\n\nWhat sets this location apart: the hours. Thursday through Saturday they run until 3am, making Pizza Karma the rare vegan-friendly late-night option in Minneapolis. When every other plant-based restaurant has closed and you're coming back from a show, Pizza Karma is still delivering. The space itself is casual and buzzy, perfect for groups.",

Come evening, the kitchen goes full-on comfort: lion's mane steak, mushroom dashi ramen, and a roasted delicata sandwich are among the standouts. A late-night menu runs until 10 or 11 pm, making Dreamstate one of the rare vegan spots in Minneapolis where you can eat well at midnight.\n\nThe bar program is serious — cocktails and mocktails are both given real attention, and a happy hour runs daily from 3 to 5 pm. The neighborhood fit feels right: Dreamstate sits next to Boneshaker Books and a cluster of independent shops, giving the block a distinct scene energy.
