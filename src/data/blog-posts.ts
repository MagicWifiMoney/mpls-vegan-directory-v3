## 🌱 Why Minneapolis Is Great for Vegan St. Patrick's Day

Minneapolis consistently ranks as one of the most vegan-friendly cities in America — and March is a great time to be here. The winter is winding down, the parade energy is high, and the city's restaurant scene is creative enough to make plant-based Irish food genuinely fun.

The Herbivorous Butcher alone makes Minneapolis a destination for vegan St. Patrick's Day — no other city in the country has a fully vegan butcher shop doing Irish-American comfort food like that.

## Valentine's Day 2026: Where to Take Your Vegan Valentine in Minneapolis

Real talk: Valentine's Day is **this Saturday** (Feb 14). If you're reading this and haven't made a reservation yet, stop scrolling and do it NOW. I'll wait.

...

Okay, now that you've (hopefully) secured a spot somewhere, let's talk strategy. Minneapolis has some genuinely excellent options for vegan Valentine's Day dining, from upscale tasting menus to cozy comfort food spots where you can actually hear each other talk.

---

## 🌹 The "I Really Like You" Tier

These are the spots that say "I put thought into this." Dress nice. Make eye contact. Maybe even put your phone away.

### Tongue in Cheek — The Classic Move

**East St. Paul | $$$ | ⭐ 4.8**

If you read our [regular date night guide](/blog/vegan-date-night-minneapolis), you know [Tongue in Cheek](/restaurants/tongue-in-cheek) is already our top pick. For Valentine's? It's even better.

*"First, any review that is less than 5 stars for this establishment is just plain wrong."* — John Madison

**The Valentine's play:**
1. **Start with the Cross-Eyed Mary cocktail** — Legendary. A veggie-infused martini that'll make you forget about boring wine.
2. **Get the Vegasm** — Yes, that's what it's called. Yes, it's appropriate for the occasion.
3. **Share the Jerk Cauliflower** — "Hit the ideal balance of spice and flavor"
4. **Linger over dessert** — They want you to stay. Let yourself.

**The vibe:** Upscale but with quirky art on the walls. Intimate without being stuffy.

**Pricing:** ~$70-90/person with drinks. Worth every penny on Valentine's.

---

## 💚 The "Let's Just Have a Great Time" Tier

Not every Valentine's needs white tablecloths. These spots are perfect for couples who'd rather laugh than whisper.

### Reverie Cafe + Bar — The Crowd Pleaser

**South Minneapolis | $$ | 100% Vegan | ⭐ 4.7**

*"This is probably the only all vegan restaurant I could safely take an omnivore to and them not think it sucks."* — Andrew Lewandowski

[Reverie](/restaurants/reverie-cafe-bar) is 100% vegan, has excellent food, and operates on a no-tipping model. Translation: no awkward "who's paying" math at the end.

**Valentine's order:**
- **Mock Duck Korean BBQ Tacos** to share
- **Mac and Cheese with Shiitake Bacon** — comfort food, elevated
- **Beignets for dessert** — don't skip these

**The vibe:** Bright and artsy. More "fun date" than "fancy date."

**Why it works:** You can actually hear each other. The prices are reasonable. Nobody's performing romance—you're just enjoying a meal together.

---

### J. Selby's — Comfort Food Love Language

**St. Paul | $$ | 100% Vegan | ⭐ 4.7**

Some people express love through fancy dinners. Some people express it through the perfect plate of comfort food. [J. Selby's](/restaurants/j-selbys) is for the second group.

**The Valentine's order:**
- **Cauliflower Wings** with ranch — start here
- **Dirty Secret Burger** — their signature, messy in the best way
- **Animal Fries** — caramelized onions, special sauce, cheese
- **Carrot Cake** — share one slice. Classic romance.

*"Constantly floored with how far vegan food has come."* — Abdiwak Yohannes

**The vibe:** Casual, busy, delicious. This is the "we don't need to prove anything" date.

---

## 🏠 The "Skip the Crowds" Option

Real talk: Valentine's Day at restaurants can be... a lot. Crowded, rushed, overpriced. Sometimes the most romantic move is opting out entirely.

### The Herbivorous Butcher At-Home Experience

**Northeast Minneapolis | $$**

Here's the play:
1. Hit up [Herbivorous Butcher](/restaurants/herbivorous-butcher) during the day
2. Grab the **Korean BBQ Ribs**, some **aged cheddar**, **Italian deli meats**
3. Pick up a nice bottle of wine (or two)
4. Cook together at home

*"We had the pleasure of having our evening meal catered by Herbivorous Butcher. It was hands-down the best meal we've had all week."* — Liz Fathman

**Why it works:**
- No reservation stress
- No time limit
- Way cheaper than restaurant + drinks
- Cooking together = built-in activity
- Leftovers = breakfast in bed

**Pro tip:** Order the ribs. They're $18.99/12oz and will be the star of your dinner.

---

## 🥞 Valentine's Morning: Brunch Edition

Start your Valentine's Day right with breakfast or brunch. Nothing says "I care" like planning the whole day, not just dinner.

### Seward Cafe — Worker-Owned Vibes

**Seward | $ | ⭐ 4.6**

[Seward Cafe](/restaurants/seward-cafe) has been a Minneapolis institution since 1974. Worker-owned, community-focused, and their vegan biscuits and gravy are legendary.

## The Ultimate Minneapolis Vegan Restaurant Guide for 2026

Let's cut the crap—finding good vegan food in Minneapolis used to feel like hunting for a needle in a haystack made entirely of bacon. But 2026? This city has absolutely *exploded* with plant-based options that'll make even your carnivore uncle shut up at Thanksgiving.

After spending an embarrassing amount of time (and money) eating my way through every vegan spot in the Twin Cities, I've compiled the definitive ranking. No corporate shilling, no sponsored posts—just honest opinions from someone who's been vegan long enough to remember when "vegan cheese" was basically orange-flavored disappointment.

## The 100% Vegan Hall of Fame

These restaurants get it. No compromises, no cross-contamination anxiety, no asking "wait, is the bread vegan?"

## Your Complete Guide to Vegan Brunch in Minneapolis

Listen, I get it. It's Saturday morning, you're slightly hungover (or completely hungover, no judgment), and you need carbs, grease, and caffeine in that exact order. The problem? Half of Minneapolis' brunch spots think "vegan option" means a sad fruit cup and dry toast.

Not these places.

I've spent way too many weekend mornings scouting the perfect vegan brunch spots, and I'm sharing the results so you don't have to suffer through another disappointing dining experience while your non-vegan friends demolish their eggs benedict in front of you.

## The Heavy Hitters

### J. Selby's — The Comfort Food Champion

**St. Paul | $$ | ⭐ 4.7 (2,900+ reviews)**

*"The breakfast burger is my number one choice every time."* — K G

[J. Selby's](/restaurants/j-selbys) is what happens when someone actually understands that vegans want *brunch food*, not health food. This is greasy, indulgent, "I might need a nap after this" territory. It's a top pick in our [complete Minneapolis vegan restaurant guide](/blog/best-vegan-restaurants-minneapolis-2026).

**The Order:**
- **Cauliflower Wings** — Start here. The ranch dipping sauce is so good people ask for extra to-go.
- **Breakfast Burger** — Their breakfast menu's crown jewel
- **Animal Fries** — Caramelized onions, special sauce, cheese. Yes.
- **Crunchwrap** — Taco Bell could never
- **Cake** — The carrot cake is "rich and delicious" according to literally everyone

*"Constantly floored with how far vegan food has come. That dang sandwich tasted like a heckin chicken fillet!"* — Abdiwak Yohannes

**Real talk:** They don't have a parking lot, so plan for street parking. Weekends can get busy, but it's worth the wait.

**Insider tip:** They use products from [Herbivorous Butcher](/restaurants/herbivorous-butcher), so the "bacon" actually tastes like bacon.

---

### Seward Cafe — The Neighborhood Institution

**Seward | $ | ⭐ 4.6 (600+ reviews)**

A worker-owned cooperative that's been feeding the neighborhood since 1974. [Seward Cafe](/restaurants/seward-cafe) has an eclectic vibe (think community bulletin boards and local art), and almost everything can be made vegan.

*"This has always been a favorite place because they have vegan biscuits and gravy on the menu."* — Alane Klein

**The Order:**
- **Vegan Biscuits and Gravy** — The reason this place is on the list. Period.
- **Tofu Scramble** — "The smoky tempeh in it was hands-down my favorite part—so flavorful and satisfying"
- **Fluffy Pancakes** — "Especially drizzled with maple syrup"
- **Vegan Breakfast Burrito** — "INCREDIBLE"
- **Monster Mash** (drink) — Hot apple cider and miso caramel topped with coconut whip. "Landing in my top 10 drinks of my life."

*"The quantity of food for the price is pretty much unmatched for vegan options."* — Alane Klein

**The vibe:** Counter service, garden patio seating in summer, and an actual community space. Not everyone's scene, but for the right person, it's perfect.

---

### Hard Times Cafe — The Punk Rock Classic

**Seward | $ | ⭐ 4.5 (500+ reviews)**

Cash only. Anarchist posters on the walls. Some of the best vegan biscuits and gravy in the city. This is Minneapolis.

*"Classic diner food and vibes but vegetarian and vegan-ified."* — Mariah Mckenzie

[Hard Times Cafe](/restaurants/hard-times-cafe) is a beloved institution and one of the [best vegan restaurants in Minneapolis](/blog/best-vegan-restaurants-minneapolis-2026).

**The Order:**
- **Vegan Biscuits and Gravy** — "A half order is plenty! The mushroom gravy is good enough to take home"
- **Helter Skelter** — Their signature scramble with all the veggies
- **Hash Browns** — Crispy, not oily
- **Any baked goods** — "Outstanding"
- **Tempeh Reuben** (if you're going savory) — "Fantastic"

*"It's been surprisingly hard for me to find good vegan food in Minneapolis, but Hard Times is a gem."* — Rachel M

**Heads up:** Cash only! There's an ATM, but save yourself the fee and come prepared. Also, expect some wait time—everything is made from scratch.

---

### Modern Times Cafe — The Uptown Favorite

**Powderhorn | $ | ⭐ 4.7 (400+ reviews)**

Progressive politics, killer tempeh, and the kind of greasy spoon vibes that make a hangover feel manageable.

*"Punk cafes 4 ever! Love all the vegan options while still fulfilling my greasy spoon cravings."* — Emily Mills

[Modern Times Cafe](/restaurants/modern-times) is perfect for when you need comfort food with a side of community.

**The Order:**
- **Deadwood with Tempeh** — "Literally salivating just thinking about it"
- **Tempeh Reuben** — "Best and freshest Reuben I have ever had! Every ingredient was so fresh"
- **Southside Hash** (veganized) — "Super delicious"
- **Breakfast Burrito** (veganized) — "Amazing"
- **House Donuts** — "They were amazing too!"

*"This very well may be my favorite restaurant in Minneapolis! Where is your tempeh from? How do you make it so good??"* — Breanna Peltz

**Pro tip:** Get there right when they open. This place fills up *fast*.

---

### French Meadow — The Crowd Pleaser

**Uptown | $$ | ⭐ 4.5 (1,000+ reviews)**

When you're brunching with a mixed group (vegans, vegetarians, and the uninitiated), [French Meadow](/restaurants/french-meadow) is your diplomatic choice. They've been doing organic and plant-based before it was trendy.

*"Great restaurant with a ton of options. They have many vegan and vegetarian items which makes it super easy to eat there as a vegan."* — Nick Koons

**The Order:**
- **Vegan Breakfast** — "Very good"
- **Veganized Breakfast Burrito** — They'll do it
- **Tempeh Reuben** — Solid
- **Dark Chocolate Sea Salt Cookie** — "Rich and flavorful without being overly sweet"
- **Vegan Chocolate Rose Cake** — "Such a treat!"
- **Oatmeal Latte** — "Tasty with just the right amount of flavoring"

**The vibe:** More upscale than the punk cafes on this list. Outdoor patio seating, full bar, and a to-go section for those in a hurry.

**Parking:** They have a free, shaded parking lot. This is actually a big deal.

---

## The Timing Strategy

Here's what I've learned after too many weekend mornings staring at wait lists:

| Restaurant | Best Time to Arrive | Expect to Wait? |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| J. Selby's | Right at opening | Yes on weekends |
| Seward Cafe | Before 10am | Usually no |
| Hard Times | Midweek mornings | Cash only—prepare |
| Modern Times | Right at opening | Yes—place fills FAST |
| French Meadow | Early or late | Usually quick |

---

## The Real Talk Section

**Best vegan biscuits and gravy:** [Hard Times](/restaurants/hard-times-cafe) or [Seward](/restaurants/seward-cafe), honestly it's a toss-up and I refuse to choose

**Best for hangovers:** [Modern Times](/restaurants/modern-times). Something about those greasy spoon vibes and progressive politics just hits different when you're feeling rough

**Best for impressing someone:** [French Meadow](/restaurants/french-meadow) or [J. Selby's](/restaurants/j-selbys). More polished, still delicious. For actual date ideas, check our [vegan date night guide](/blog/vegan-date-night-minneapolis).

**Best value:** Hard Times. Cheap, filling, excellent. Cash only though.

**Best if you want to also day drink:** Seward Cafe's garden patio with a Monster Mash, or French Meadow's full bar

---

## What to Know Before You Go

1. **J. Selby's** — Street parking only, no lot
2. **Seward Cafe** — Counter service, you pick up your food when called
3. **Hard Times** — CASH ONLY (ATM inside)
4. **Modern Times** — Gets packed, arrive early
5. **French Meadow** — Has a parking lot (rare!)

---

## My Personal Sunday Rotation

Look, I'm not going to pretend I don't have favorites. My typical Sunday rotation goes like this:

- **Feeling bougie:** French Meadow patio with a mimosa
- **Need grease immediately:** Hard Times, biscuits and gravy, no questions
- **Taking out-of-towners:** J. Selby's—it shuts up the "vegan food is boring" crowd real quick
- **Just vibing:** Seward Cafe garden, Monster Mash, people watching

Now go forth and brunch. 🥞🌱

## The Ultimate Guide to Vegan Date Night in Minneapolis

So you've got a date. Congrats. And either you're vegan, they're vegan, or you both are (jackpot). The problem? Most "romantic restaurant" lists assume you're cool with a menu that's 90% meat with a token portobello mushroom entrée hiding at the bottom.

Not this list.

These are spots where the vegan options are *actually good*, the atmosphere doesn't scream "we're at a health food store," and you might actually get a second date.

---

## The Top Tier: Worth Getting Dressed Up For

### Tongue in Cheek

**East St. Paul | $$$ | ⭐ 4.8**

*"First, any review that is less than 5 stars for this establishment is just plain wrong."* — John Madison

Let me be clear: [Tongue in Cheek](/restaurants/tongue-in-cheek) is probably the best restaurant in the Twin Cities for a vegan date night. It's not 100% vegan, but the vegan options are so thoughtfully executed that you'll forget to be jealous of whatever your date is eating.

**The Vibe:** Upscale but not stuffy. Quirky art on the walls. The kind of place where you feel sophisticated without pretending to be someone you're not.

**The Move:**
1. Start with cocktails. The **Cross-Eyed Mary** is legendary — "essentially a bloody mary like martini, gin infused with vegetables. I have to stop myself from drinking more than two."
2. Get the **Teasers** (small plates). "The appetizers and small bites are where it's at: jerk cauliflower, mascarpone polenta, potato pave."
3. Main course: **Vegasm** (yes, it's really called that) or the **Pad Thai Salad** — "my favorite dish"
4. The **Jerk Cauliflower** — "hit the ideal balance of spice and flavor"

*"One of my fav restaurants in MN. Wonderful service and staff as well. Dining here can turn the worst of days around."* — Hollie Chase

**Pricing:** Expect ~$60-80/person with drinks. Worth it. This restaurant is also featured in our [best vegan restaurants guide](/blog/best-vegan-restaurants-minneapolis-2026).

---

### Reverie Cafe + Bar

**South Minneapolis | $$ | ⭐ 4.7**

*"This is probably the only all vegan restaurant I could safely take an omnivore to and them not think it sucks."* — Andrew Lewandowski

If your date is skeptical about vegan food, [Reverie](/restaurants/reverie-cafe-bar) is your secret weapon. Everything is 100% vegan, but it doesn't taste like it's *trying* to be healthy. It just tastes good.

**The Vibe:** Bright, artsy, casual but intentional. Not as fancy as Tongue in Cheek, but perfect for a second or third date when you want good food without the pressure.

**The Move:**
- **Mock Duck Korean BBQ Tacos** — "Outstanding. So much texture and the flavor of the mock duck was delicious"
- **Mac and Cheese with Shiitake Bacon** — "Mature and smokey"
- **Beignets** — Do not skip these
- **The Rev Burger** — If one of you wants comfort food

*"They pay their workers a living wage and are therefore a non-tipping establishment."* — Hallee Caron

**Bonus:** Counter service means no awkward "who's paying" moment. You both just order and split naturally.

---

### Francis Burger Joint

**Northeast Minneapolis | $$ | ⭐ 4.7**

*"These burgers are better than most meat burger joints I've been to."* — Jordan E-B

For when you want a date that's fun, casual, and involves the best vegan burgers in the city. [Francis Burger Joint](/restaurants/francis-burger-joint) is part of the vibrant [Northeast Minneapolis vegan scene](/blog/northeast-minneapolis-vegan-guide).

**The Vibe:** Cool, casual Northeast spot with murals, good music, and zero pretension. Perfect for a "let's just hang and see where this goes" vibe.

**The Move:**
- **Juicy Lucy** — The Minnesota classic, veganized perfectly. "Haven't stopped thinking about it since I had it a few days ago."
- **Hunny Dijon Chicken Sandwich** — "By far the most chicken-like substitute I've ever had"
- **Fries** — "MUCH better than other places"
- **Chocolate Milkshake** — To share. Obviously.
- **"Kind of a Big Dill" Cocktail** — "What all of the State Fair pickle drinks should aspire to be"

*"Cool vibe and unique spot. This is a no-tipping establishment."* — Archibald Chuzzlewit

**Why it works for dates:** The QR code ordering means no pressure, the food is shareable, and nothing says "I'm fun to be around" like knowing about a secret vegan Juicy Lucy spot.

---

## Special Occasion Tier

### Masu Sushi & Robata

**Northeast Minneapolis | $$$ | ⭐ 4.6**

Not 100% vegan, but the vegan sushi options at [Masu](/restaurants/masu-sushi) are *excellent*, and the atmosphere is unmistakably date night material.

**The Vibe:** Moody lighting, beautiful presentation, the kind of place where you feel like you're in a movie.

**What to order:**
- Vegetable rolls (they have several, all good)
- Edamame
- The robata vegetables (grilled over charcoal)
- Ask your server—they're usually great about steering you toward the best plant-based options

**Pro tip:** Sit at the bar if you can. More intimate than a table.

---

## The Casual-But-Still-Romantic Options

### Herbivorous Butcher

**Northeast Minneapolis | $$ | ⭐ 4.8**

*"We had the pleasure of having our evening meal catered by Herbivorous Butcher. It was hands down the best meal we've had all week."* — Liz Fathman

Wait, hear me out. It's a butcher shop, but [The Herbivorous Butcher](/restaurants/herbivorous-butcher) has seating and ready-to-eat sandwiches. For a casual daytime date, nothing says "I know cool stuff" like taking someone to America's first vegan butcher shop.

**The Move:**
- **Italian Cold Cut Sandwich** — "Amazing"
- **Hot Bacon Brat with Cheese** — Share this
- Split some meats and cheeses to take home

**Why it works:** It's different, memorable, and you'll have leftovers for a late-night snack if the date goes well. Check out our full [Northeast Minneapolis vegan guide](/blog/northeast-minneapolis-vegan-guide) for more spots in the area.

---

## The Dinner-to-Drinks Pipeline

Here's my recommended progression for a perfect date night:

**Option A: The Upscale Route**
1. Drinks at Tongue in Cheek → Dinner at Tongue in Cheek → Walk along the river

**Option B: The NE Minneapolis Tour**
1. Early dinner at [Francis Burger Joint](/restaurants/francis-burger-joint) → Drinks at a nearby NE brewery → Stop by [Herbivorous Butcher](/restaurants/herbivorous-butcher) if they're open

**Option C: The South Minneapolis Chill**
1. Dinner at [Reverie](/restaurants/reverie-cafe-bar) → Walk around Lake Harriet or Bde Maka Ska → Ice cream (if any vegan spots are open)

---

## Quick Reference: What Kind of Date Are We Talking?

| Situation | Go Here | Why |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| First date | [Reverie](/restaurants/reverie-cafe-bar) | Casual, no pressure, easy to split |
| Impressive second date | [Tongue in Cheek](/restaurants/tongue-in-cheek) | The food speaks for itself |
| Fun and casual | [Francis](/restaurants/francis-burger-joint) | Burgers + milkshakes = success |
| Special occasion | [Masu](/restaurants/masu-sushi) | Fancy vibes, great sushi |
| Weekend daytime date | [Herbivorous Butcher](/restaurants/herbivorous-butcher) | Unique, memorable, delicious |

---

## Pro Tips for Vegan Date Success

1. **Make a reservation if you can.** Tongue in Cheek especially.
2. **Check the menu beforehand.** You don't want your date watching you panic-scroll the menu.
3. **Order stuff to share.** Food sharing = intimacy points.
4. **Tip well.** (Except at Francis and Reverie—no tipping!) Shows you're a good person.
5. **Don't lecture about veganism.** Let the food speak for itself.

---

## The Honest Truth

If you're looking for fancy white tablecloth fine dining that's 100% vegan... Minneapolis isn't quite there yet. But the options we *do* have are genuinely excellent, and places like Tongue in Cheek and Reverie can hold their own against any restaurant in the city.

The best date isn't about the fanciest restaurant anyway. It's about good food, good conversation, and not having to explain to a waiter what "plant-based" means for the fifteenth time.

Happy dating. 🌱💚

## A Walking Tour of Northeast Minneapolis' Best Vegan Spots

Northeast Minneapolis is where Minneapolis gets weird in the best way. Old warehouses turned into breweries, artists' studios next to meat markets, and somehow—right in the middle of it all—the best vegan food scene in the city.

This is your complete guide to eating vegan in NE, organized as a walking tour for maximum efficiency (and maximum eating).

---

## Stop 1: The Herbivorous Butcher

**507 1st Ave NE | $$ | ⭐ 4.8 (1,500+ reviews)**

Start here. You have to.

[The Herbivorous Butcher](/restaurants/herbivorous-butcher) is America's first vegan butcher shop, and if you haven't been, you're missing out on one of the most innovative food concepts in the country. Siblings Aubry and Kale Walch opened this place in 2016, and they've been quietly changing minds about what vegan meat can be ever since.

*"Fake meat never tasted this good."* — Actual review

### The Products

**Meats (yes, we're calling them that):**
| Item | Price | The Deal |
|------|-------|----------|
| Korean BBQ Ribs | $18.99/12oz | Best-selling item. "Tender meaty texture, perfect sweet-savory balance" |
| Pastrami | $15.99/8oz | "Deeply seasoned with cracked pepper, coriander, and warm spices" |
| Italian Sausage | $16.99/13oz | 4 fully-cooked brat links, fennel and sun-dried tomatoes |
| Pepperoni | $13.00/8oz | "Perfect for pizza" |

- Aged Cheddar ($14.99/8oz) — "Sharp, creamy, melts beautifully"
- Smoked Gouda — "Fantastic. One of the best non-dairy cheeses we have had"
- Havarti variations — Garlic pepper and dill

### The Ready-to-Eat Options

Don't sleep on the deli counter. These are some of the best sandwiches in the city.

*"One of the best Italian Cold Cut Sandwiches that I've ever had."* — Amber Schlater

- **Italian Cold Cut** ($17.49) — As seen on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. Pastrami, capicola, pepperoni, mozzarella on a hoagie.
- **Hot Bacon Brat with Cheese** — "Both loved it"
- **Ranchy Bacon Mac Hot Panini** — When it's the special, GET IT

### Pro Tips
- **Best time to go:** Weekday mornings or early afternoon. Weekend lines are "out the door"

This spot is also featured in our [best Minneapolis vegan restaurants guide](/blog/best-vegan-restaurants-minneapolis-2026) and makes a great [unique date idea](/blog/vegan-date-night-minneapolis).

---

## Walk: Herbivorous Butcher → Francis Burger Joint (0.8 mi, 15 min)

Head north on Central Ave through the heart of NE. Grab a coffee if you need it.

---

## Stop 2: Francis Burger Joint

**2318 Central Ave NE | $$ | ⭐ 4.7**

*"Delightful food options for a vegetarian feeling oppressed by America's meat-forward culture. Honestly some of the best burgers I've ever eaten."* — Davi Gray

[Francis](/restaurants/francis-burger-joint) is everything a vegan burger joint should be: the burgers are legitimately better than most meat spots, the vibe is fun, and the milkshakes actually taste like milkshakes.

### The Must-Orders

**The Juicy Lucy** — The Minnesota classic, veganized. Impossible patty stuffed with vegan cheese.
*"Haven't stopped thinking about it since I had it a few days ago."* — Actual review

**The Chicken Sandwich** — Multiple reviewers call this "the most chicken-like substitute I've ever had."
*"By far the most chicken-like substitute I've ever had and this isn't coming from someone who hasn't had chicken in 20 years—I had some last week."* — Kyle McCleary

**The Fries** — "MUCH better than other places"

**Chocolate Milkshake** — "I don't think I've ever had a vegan chocolate milkshake (let alone a good vegan chocolate milkshake) before coming here"

### The Vibe

Cool murals, good music, a crowd that's half art school kids and half neighborhood regulars. No-tipping establishment (it's built into prices), which makes ordering stress-free.

*"I go to Francis way more often than I reasonably should."* — Brandon Sullivan

Francis is perfect for a casual [vegan date night](/blog/vegan-date-night-minneapolis).

---

---

## Stop 3: Masu Sushi & Robata

**330 E Hennepin Ave | $$$**

**What to get:**
- Vegetable rolls (several options)
- Robata-grilled vegetables
- Edamame
- Ask your server for recommendations

The charcoal robata grill adds a smoky depth that works beautifully with vegetables. The atmosphere is moody and intimate—this is where you end the day if you're on a date. See our [vegan date night guide](/blog/vegan-date-night-minneapolis) for more romantic options.

---

## The Neighborhood Vibe

NE Minneapolis is walkable, bikeable, and absolutely packed with breweries if you need a break between meals. Some highlights:

- **Indeed Brewing** — Great patio
- **Bauhaus Brew Labs** — The building alone is worth seeing
- **Dangerous Man Brewing** — Small, cash only, excellent

Most NE breweries don't have food, so grab takeout from [Herbivorous Butcher](/restaurants/herbivorous-butcher) or [Francis](/restaurants/francis-burger-joint) and bring it with you.

---

## Parking & Getting There

**By Car:**

---

## Why NE is the Best Vegan Neighborhood in MPLS

Let's be real: most Minneapolis neighborhoods have maybe one or two vegan options. NE has:
- The literal best vegan butcher shop in America
- A burger joint that makes carnivores question their life choices
- Walkable streets full of character
- Breweries everywhere (most are vegan-friendly)
- A community that *gets it*

The artists and weirdos who made NE cool also made it accepting. Nobody bats an eye at vegan food here—it's just... food.

---

## Pro Tips for Your NE Vegan Day

1. **Start early at Herbivorous Butcher** — Popular items sell out
2. **Bring a cooler** — If you're buying meats/cheeses to take home
3. **Make a reservation at Masu** — Especially weekends
4. **Francis closes at 9pm** — Plan accordingly
5. **Wear comfortable shoes** — You're walking

---

This neighborhood is proof that vegan food doesn't have to exist in its own little bubble. It can be right there next to the breweries and art studios and dive bars, just being part of the neighborhood.

      {
        question: "How do you eat Ethiopian food?",

## A Complete Guide to Ethiopian Vegan Food in Minneapolis

Here's a secret that vegans who've lived in Minneapolis for a while already know: Ethiopian food is *incredible* for plant-based eating. It's not an afterthought or a modification—Ethiopian cuisine has been doing vegan feasts for centuries, long before it was trendy.

Why? Ethiopian Orthodox Christians observe numerous fasting days throughout the year where they eat only plant-based foods. This means Ethiopian restaurants have extensive, well-developed vegan menus that aren't just "the meat dish minus the meat." These are recipes perfected over generations.

And Minneapolis? We've got one of the largest Ethiopian communities in the country, which means some of the best Ethiopian food outside of Addis Ababa.

---

## Ethiopian Food 101 (For Beginners)

If you've never had Ethiopian food, here's what you need to know:

### Injera: The Foundation

Everything sits on injera—a spongy, slightly sour flatbread made from teff flour. It's:
- Naturally gluten-free (when made with 100% teff)
- Vegan
- Delicious
- Also your utensil—you tear off pieces and use them to scoop up food

### The Veggie Combo: Your Best Friend

Most Ethiopian restaurants offer a "veggie combo" or "veggie sampler." This is usually 4-6 different vegetable and legume dishes served together on a big platter of injera. It's:
- The best value
- The best way to try everything
- Perfect for sharing

### Common Vegan Ethiopian Dishes

| Dish | What It Is | Why You'll Love It |
|------|-----------|-------------------|

**Minneapolis | $$ | 100% VEGAN**

This is it. The highest-rated restaurant on our entire [Minneapolis vegan directory](/blog/best-vegan-restaurants-minneapolis-2026). 4.9 stars. All vegan.

*"Minneapolis has many options for Ethiopian food, and Lulu is the best of them all."* — Matthew Racchini

[Lulu EthioVegan](/restaurants/lulu-ethiovegan) isn't just vegan Ethiopian food—it's one of the best vegan restaurants in the city, period. Owner Lulu and her family run the place with genuine warmth, and the food is consistently incredible.

---

### Bole Ethiopian ⭐ 4.8 (200+ reviews)

**Maple Grove | $$**

Not 100% vegan, but the vegetarian/vegan options at [Bole Ethiopian](/restaurants/bole-ethiopian) are outstanding. This is the spot if you're in the northwest suburbs.

*"Some of the best Ethiopian food in the Twin Cities. Everything is so flavorful."* — Andrew Zay

## How to Eat Ethiopian Food

If this is your first time, here's the protocol:

1. **Skip the utensils.** This is a hands-on experience. (But utensils are usually available if you really need them.)

2. **Tear, don't cut.** Rip off a piece of injera with your fingers.

3. **Scoop and fold.** Use the injera piece to pick up some of the food, wrapping it slightly.

4. **Use your right hand.** Traditional etiquette, though no one will judge you in Minneapolis.

5. **Share.** Ethiopian food is meant to be communal. Order a big sampler and eat from the same platter.

6. **Pace yourself.** The injera is filling. The dishes are rich. You'll eat more than you think.

---

## The Fasting Tradition Explained

Ethiopian Orthodox Christians observe fasting days on Wednesdays and Fridays year-round, plus longer fasting periods including the 55-day Great Lent. During fasting, no animal products are consumed.

This isn't like Western "vegan options"—it's a deeply integrated part of the cuisine. The vegan dishes at Ethiopian restaurants are just as complex, flavorful, and celebrated as the meat dishes. You're not getting the B-side menu.

---

## Comparison: Where Should You Go?

| Situation | Go Here |
|-----------|---------|
| First Ethiopian experience | [Lulu EthioVegan](/restaurants/lulu-ethiovegan) |
| In the suburbs | [Bole Ethiopian](/restaurants/bole-ethiopian) |
| Quick lunch downtown | [Afro Deli](/restaurants/afro-deli) |
| 100% vegan requirement | [Lulu EthioVegan](/restaurants/lulu-ethiovegan) |
| Date night | [Bole Ethiopian](/restaurants/bole-ethiopian) |
| Budget meal | [Afro Deli](/restaurants/afro-deli) |

---

## What to Expect Price-Wise

Ethiopian food is generally affordable:
- **Veggie combo for one:** $18-22
- **Sampler for 2-3 people:** $35-45
- **Sambusa appetizer:** $6-10
- **Drinks/dessert:** $3-6

You'll likely leave with leftovers.

---

## Tips for Ordering

1. **Ask about spice levels.** Some dishes are naturally mild (alicha = mild), some are spicy (wot = often spicy). Staff can guide you.

2. **Get the combo.** It's almost always the best value and best way to experience the cuisine.

3. **Save room for injera.** You'll eat more bread than you expect.

4. **Order extra injera if needed.** If you run out, you can get more.

5. **Try the drinks.** Ethiopian coffee ceremony is famous. The ginger tea is usually excellent.

---

## Final Thoughts

Ethiopian food is one of the best-kept secrets for vegans in Minneapolis. While everyone's arguing about which vegan burger is best, there's a whole cuisine that's been perfecting plant-based dishes for centuries.

[Lulu EthioVegan's](/restaurants/lulu-ethiovegan) 4.9-star rating isn't an accident. These aren't compromise dishes or modifications—they're the real deal, made by people who grew up eating this way.

If you haven't tried Ethiopian food yet, let this be your sign. If you have, you already know.

**Embrace the grain bowl:** Base of grain + protein + veggies + sauce = infinite variations with minimal effort.

## Best Vegan Comfort Food in Minneapolis: A Guide to Indulgent Plant-Based Eating

Let's get one thing straight: comfort food isn't about kale salads or quinoa bowls. Comfort food is greasy, cheesy, fried, saucy, and completely unapologetic. It's what you crave after a long day, a breakup, or when the Minnesota winter makes you question all your life choices.

The good news? Minneapolis has absolutely nailed vegan comfort food. We're talking mac and cheese that'll make you forget dairy exists, burgers that carnivores order on purpose, and pizza loaded with actual melty cheese (yes, vegan).

This is your guide to eating your feelings, Minneapolis vegan style.

## Best Vegan Bakeries in Minneapolis: Your Complete Guide to Plant-Based Pastries

There's something deeply comforting about walking into a bakery—the smell of fresh bread, the sight of perfectly frosted cakes, the promise of a cinnamon roll so good it might change your day. For vegans, though, that experience has historically been… complicated.

"Is the bread vegan?" "Does this have eggs?" "Wait, is butter dairy?" The constant interrogation ruins the vibe.

Not anymore. Minneapolis has a thriving vegan bakery scene where you can just walk in, point at something beautiful, and know it's safe to eat. These aren't "vegan alternatives"—they're legitimately excellent bakeries that happen to be vegan (or vegan-friendly).

Here's your complete guide to vegan baked goods in Minneapolis.

## The Best Vegan Ice Cream in the Twin Cities (2026)

Let me save you some time: the days of vegans staring sadly at a freezer case full of nothing but fruit sorbet are OVER. The Twin Cities' vegan ice cream scene has quietly gotten incredible, and most people—including a lot of vegans—don't even know it yet.

I've eaten an embarrassing amount of dairy-free ice cream over the past year to compile this guide. My waistline suffered. My taste buds thrived. You're welcome.

---

## 🏆 The Best Scoop Shops

### Crepe & Spoon — The Undisputed Champion

**Northeast Minneapolis | 100% Vegan | ⭐ 4.8**

This isn't even close. [Crepe & Spoon](/restaurants/crepe-and-spoon) makes all their ice cream **in-house, from scratch, every day.** And I mean *real* ice cream—rich, creamy, scoopable-from-the-freezer ice cream that happens to contain zero dairy.

**Flavors worth the trip:**
- **Blueberry Cardamom** — Sounds fancy, tastes like a warm hug from someone who really knows what they're doing
- **Coconut Ash** — Jet black, slightly sweet, Instagram gold
- **Salted Caramel** — The one that converts skeptics. "This is VEGAN?!" Yes. Yes it is.
- **Cookie Dough** — Chunks of actual cookie dough. Not crumbles. Chunks.
- **Seasonal rotations** — They change flavors regularly, which is both exciting and slightly maddening when your favorite disappears

**The move:** Get a scoop in one of their fresh-made crepes. Sweet crepe + ice cream = the best $12 you'll spend this week.

**Pro tip:** They're in [Northeast Minneapolis](/neighborhoods/northeast), so combine this with a visit to [Herbivorous Butcher](/restaurants/herbivorous-butcher) just blocks away. Savory lunch → sweet finish.

## 🛒 Best Grocery Store Pints

Not every ice cream craving requires putting on pants and leaving the house. Here's what to stock in your freezer.

### The Top Tier

| Brand | Base | Best Flavor | Where to Buy | Price Range |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------- |-------------|
| **Coconut Bliss** | Coconut milk | Salted Caramel & Chocolate | Wedge, Mississippi Market, Lunds | $6-8 |
| **Eclipse** | Oat/potato | Cookie Butter | Whole Foods, Lunds | $7-9 |
| **Oatly** | Oat milk | Strawberry | Most grocery stores | $5-7 |
| **NadaMoo!** | Coconut milk | Lotta Mint Chip | Whole Foods, co-ops | $6-8 |
| **So Delicious** | Various | Cashew Milk Snickerdoodle | Everywhere | $5-6 |

### The Honest Rankings

**For "tastes most like real ice cream":** Eclipse. Their proprietary blend somehow nails that dairy fat mouthfeel. The cookie butter flavor is genuinely dangerous.

**For richest/most indulgent:** Coconut Bliss. The coconut milk base makes everything incredibly creamy. Warning: you will eat the whole pint.

**For best value:** So Delicious. Available literally everywhere, consistently good, and the most affordable option. The cashew milk line is the best.

**For oat milk fans:** Oatly. Light, clean taste, great if you find coconut-based ice creams too heavy. The strawberry is simple and perfect.

**For adventurous flavors:** NadaMoo! They get creative with flavors like Birthday Cake Cookie Dough and Java Crunch. Not every swing connects, but when it does, it's a home run.

## Best Vegan Pizza in Minneapolis: Every Slice, Ranked

Let's be honest: pizza is the thing vegans miss most. Not because it's hard to make vegan pizza—it isn't—but because *bad* vegan pizza is really, tragically bad. Plasticky cheese that doesn't melt. Sad vegetables on cardboard crust. We've all been there.

Good news: Minneapolis actually has several places that get vegan pizza right. I've eaten my way through all of them and ranked every slice so you can skip the disappointment and go straight to the good stuff.

---

## 🏆 The Rankings

### #1: Pizza Lucé — The Undisputed Champion

**Multiple Locations | $$ | ⭐ 4.6**

This isn't even a fair fight. [Pizza Lucé](/restaurants/pizza-luce) has been doing vegan pizza since before most restaurants knew what the word meant, and their house-made vegan cheese is in a completely different league from anything else in the city.

**Why they're #1:**
- **House-made vegan mozzarella** that actually *melts and stretches*. This is not Daiya. This is not Follow Your Heart. This is cheese they make in-house, and it's legitimately good.
- **Vegan ricotta** — yes, they have TWO vegan cheeses
- Multiple locations across the metro
- **Late-night delivery** — real pizza, real late, actually vegan

**The must-order pizzas:**

🥇 **Baked Potato Pizza** — The legend. Vegan cheese, potatoes, vegan sour cream, scallions. Sounds weird. Tastes incredible. This is the pizza that converted me from a "vegan pizza is okay I guess" person to a fanatic.

🥈 **Veggie Lucé** — Artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes, kalamata olives, roasted red peppers, pesto, vegan mozzarella. This is the "I'm ordering for the table and everyone needs to be impressed" pizza.

🥉 **Build Your Own** — Their vegetable toppings are high-quality (not from a can), so building your own with vegan mozz is always a solid move. Go heavy on the roasted garlic.

**Pro tips:**
- Ask for the vegan ranch dipping sauce. Life-changing with crust.
- The downtown location has the best late-night vibes
- Order online to skip the wait on Friday/Saturday nights

---

### #2: Black Sheep Pizza — Best Crust in the City

**North Loop + NE Minneapolis | $$ | ⭐ 4.5**

If Pizza Lucé wins on cheese, [Black Sheep](/restaurants/black-sheep-pizza) wins on crust. Their coal-fired oven produces this incredible char that you can't get anywhere else in Minneapolis.

**What makes them special:**
- **Coal-fired crust** — Blistered, slightly charred, chewy in the middle. This is crust with actual character.
- Vegan cheese available on any pizza
- Quality vegetable toppings that char beautifully in the oven
- Industrial-cool North Loop location with open kitchen

**Best vegan orders:**
- **Seasonal Vegetable Pizza** — Whatever's fresh, charred in the coal oven. Simple and perfect.
- **Build your own with vegan cheese** — Mushrooms + roasted garlic + cherry tomatoes + arugula (added after baking)
- **Margherita-style** with vegan mozz — Lets the crust be the star

**The vibe:** North Loop industrial-chic. Great for groups where not everyone is vegan—the regular pizzas are excellent too, so nobody feels like they're at a "vegan place."

---

### #3: Pizza Karma — Best Budget and Late-Night Pick

**Dinkytown | $ | ⭐ 4.3**

[Pizza Karma](/restaurants/pizza-karma) earns the third spot for doing something no other place on this list does: fire-roasted pizza with South Asian flavor influences, open until 3am on weekends, at student-friendly prices.

**What makes them unique:**
- **Dairy-free cheese** clearly labeled on the menu
- Fire-roasted crust with notes of chili, cumin, and garam masala
- Open until 3am Thursday through Saturday
- Most pies under $15
- Vegan toppings called out across the board

**Best vegan orders:**
- Any pizza with dairy-free cheese (the fire-roast brings out great flavor on plant-based versions)
- Veggie-heavy pies where the South Asian spice profiles shine

**Who should go here:** Anyone near the University of Minnesota, night owls, and fans of adventurous pizza flavor profiles that you won't find anywhere else in the city.

*Note: Galactic Pizza, a longtime Lyn-Lake institution beloved for eco-friendly delivery by electric car, permanently closed in March 2024 after 20 years in business.*

---

### Bonus: Pizza Karma — Best Late-Night Option (Dinkytown)

**409 14th Ave SE, Dinkytown | $ | ⭐ 4.3**

[Pizza Karma](/restaurants/pizza-karma) is a Dinkytown institution that doesn't fit neatly into any category — it's fire-roasted pizza with South Asian influences, and it's one of the most vegan-friendly pizza places in the city.

**Why they're worth knowing:**
- **Dairy-free cheese** clearly labeled on the menu — no guessing required
- **Vegan toppings** called out across the board
- Fire-roasted crust with Indian-inspired flavor profiles (chili, cumin, garam masala notes)
- **Open until 3am Thursday–Saturday** — the only late-night vegan pizza in the University area
- Student prices: most pizzas under $15

**Best vegan orders:**
- Any pizza with dairy-free cheese substitution (they nail the fire-roast on plant-based versions)
- Veggie-heavy pies where the South Asian spices shine most

**Who should go here:** University of Minnesota students, anyone in Dinkytown past midnight, fans of adventurous flavor profiles. This is not a place for a quiet date night — it's for a group of friends at 1am who want something cheap, delicious, and genuinely fun.

Not in the top 3 for daytime artisan pizza, but it holds a unique position in the Minneapolis vegan pizza scene that no other place fills.

## 🏠 The DIY Option: Herbivorous Butcher Pepperoni

Here's a move that most people don't think of: buy pepperoni from [The Herbivorous Butcher](/restaurants/herbivorous-butcher) and put it on your own pizza at home.

**Why this works:**
- Their pepperoni is *spicy, charred-edge, pizza perfection* (real quote from their menu)
- Pair it with store-bought vegan mozzarella (Miyoko's is the best for melting)
- Use a cast iron skillet or pizza stone
- Total cost: ~$8-10 for a pizza that rivals anything in this guide

**The recipe:**
1. Store-bought pizza dough (Trader Joe's herb dough is great)
2. San Marzano tomato sauce
3. Miyoko's mozzarella, shredded
4. Herbivorous Butcher pepperoni, sliced thin
5. 500°F oven, cast iron or pizza stone, 10-12 minutes
6. Fresh basil on top. Chef's kiss.

## 🍕 Pizza Night Playbook

### Friday Night with Friends
**Go to:** Pizza Lucé downtown → order 3-4 pizzas for the table → vegan ranch on the side → don't forget the Baked Potato Pizza

### Date Night Pizza
**Go to:** Black Sheep North Loop → sit at the bar → watch the coal oven → share a bottle of wine + seasonal vegetable pizza

### Lazy Sunday Delivery
**Order from:** Pizza Lucé → Baked Potato Pizza + any build-your-own with house-made vegan cheese → fastest vegan pizza delivery in the city

### Impress-Your-Non-Vegan-Friends Pizza

---

## The Bottom Line

You don't have to sacrifice pizza to be vegan in Minneapolis. [Pizza Lucé](/restaurants/pizza-luce) is the best overall (that cheese!), [Black Sheep](/restaurants/black-sheep-pizza) has the best crust, and [Pizza Karma](/restaurants/pizza-karma) is the move when you're out late in Dinkytown and need something good and cheap.

And when all else fails, [Herbivorous Butcher](/restaurants/herbivorous-butcher) pepperoni on a homemade pie might be the best vegan pizza of all.

## Best Vegan Mac and Cheese Brands: The Definitive 2026 Rankings

Here's the thing about vegan mac and cheese: it ranges from "oh my god this is incredible" to "did someone melt a crayon into pasta?" There's almost no middle ground.

We bought every vegan mac and cheese brand we could get our hands on, cooked them all according to package directions (we're scientists, not animals), and ranked them from best to "please stop making this." We also threw in our favorite restaurant mac and cheese for good measure, because Minneapolis has at least one vegan mac that puts every boxed version to shame.

Let's do this.

## 🏆 The Final Rankings: Boxed Vegan Mac & Cheese

### #1: Goodles Cheddy Mac

**Overall Score: 9.2/10**

| Category | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| Cheese Flavor | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Texture | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Creaminess | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Value | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Availability | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**The verdict:** Goodles absolutely nailed it. The sauce is creamy, tangy, and actually tastes like cheese—not "cheese-flavored product." The noodles are made with hidden vegetables and protein, which is a nice bonus when you're eating your third box this week (no judgment).

**What sets it apart:** The sauce has this slight sharpness that mimics aged cheddar. Most vegan mac sauces either taste like nothing or taste aggressively of nutritional yeast. Goodles found the sweet spot.

**Where to buy:** Target, Whole Foods, Thrive Market, Amazon
**Price:** ~$4-5/box

---

### #2: Annie's Organic Vegan Shells & Creamy Sauce

**Overall Score: 8.8/10**

| Category | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| Cheese Flavor | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Texture | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Creaminess | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Value | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Availability | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**The verdict:** The best value in vegan mac and cheese. Annie's has been doing this longer than most brands, and it shows. Organic pasta, creamy sauce with a slightly tangy finish, and available literally everywhere.

**What sets it apart:** Consistency and price. Every box tastes the same (in a good way), and at $3-4 it's the most affordable option that doesn't taste like cardboard.

**Pro tip:** Add a tablespoon of Miyoko's butter and a splash of oat milk while cooking. Takes it from 8.8 to about 9.5.

**Where to buy:** Target, Walmart, every grocery store, Amazon
**Price:** ~$3-4/box

---

### #3: Banza Vegan Mac & Cheese

**Overall Score: 8.5/10**

| Category | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| Cheese Flavor | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Texture | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Creaminess | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Value | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Availability | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**The verdict:** If you want high-protein, chickpea-based noodles with vegan cheese, Banza is your move. The pasta has more texture and a slightly nuttier flavor than traditional noodles, and the cheese sauce is solid.

**What sets it apart:** 25g of protein per box from the chickpea pasta. If you're a vegan who actually cares about macros, this is the one.

**Caveat:** The chickpea pasta releases starch differently, so the sauce can be a bit thicker. Add extra liquid.

**Where to buy:** Target, Whole Foods, most grocery stores
**Price:** ~$4-5/box

---

### #4: Modern Table Mac & Cheese

**Overall Score: 8.2/10**

| Category | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| Cheese Flavor | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Texture | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Creaminess | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Value | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Availability | ⭐⭐⭐ |

**The verdict:** Lentil-based noodles with a surprisingly good cheese sauce. Not quite as refined as Goodles or Annie's, but a strong option for anyone avoiding gluten.

**What sets it apart:** The lentil pasta gives it extra protein and fiber without the chickpea flavor of Banza.

**Where to buy:** Whole Foods, Target, co-ops
**Price:** ~$4-5/box

---

### #5: Daiya Deluxe Cheddar Style

**Overall Score: 7.9/10**

| Category | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| Cheese Flavor | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Texture | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Creaminess | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Value | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Availability | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**The verdict:** The best **frozen/microwaveable** option. Daiya Deluxe comes with a pre-made sauce (not powder), which makes it incredibly creamy with minimal effort. The cheese flavor is milder than the top picks but still satisfying.

**What sets it apart:** Easiest prep of any option. Boil noodles, stir in sauce, done. No butter, no milk substitute required.

**Where to buy:** Literally everywhere — Target, Walmart, every grocery store
**Price:** ~$4-5/box

---

## 📊 The Full Comparison

| Brand | Score | Protein | Best For | Price |
|-------|-------|---------|----------|-------|
| **Goodles** | 9.2 | 17g | Best overall taste | $4-5 |
| **Annie's** | 8.8 | 8g | Best value | $3-4 |
| **Banza** | 8.5 | 25g | Highest protein | $4-5 |
| **Modern Table** | 8.2 | 14g | Gluten-conscious | $4-5 |
| **Daiya Deluxe** | 7.9 | 7g | Easiest prep | $4-5 |

## 🍽️ Best Vegan Mac & Cheese at Minneapolis Restaurants

Sometimes you don't want to cook. We get it. Here's where to get the best vegan mac and cheese served to you on a plate, by a human, with a drink in your other hand.

### #1: Reverie Cafe + Bar — The GOAT

**South Minneapolis | $$ | 100% Vegan**

[Reverie's](/restaurants/reverie-cafe-bar) Mac and Cheese with Shiitake Bacon is the best vegan mac and cheese in Minneapolis. Period. Full stop. End of discussion.

*"Mac and cheese? Bangs. Burger? Bangs."* — Andrew Lewandowski

**What makes it special:** The shiitake bacon adds this smoky, umami depth that no boxed brand can touch. The cheese sauce is rich without being heavy. It's scratch-made with real ingredients, not reconstituted powder.

**The move:** Get it as a side with their Mock Duck Korean BBQ Tacos. You're welcome.

---

### #2: J. Selby's — Comfort Food King

**St. Paul | $$ | 100% Vegan**

[J. Selby's](/restaurants/j-selbys) does mac and cheese the way it should be done: loaded, creamy, and absolutely zero pretension.

**What makes it special:** It's classic comfort mac—no weird twists, no "elevated" anything. Just really good vegan mac and cheese that satisfies the craving perfectly.

---

## 🛠️ The DIY Move: Make Your Own

If you're feeling ambitious, here's the secret formula that beats every boxed brand:

### The 10-Minute Scratch Mac

**Ingredients:**
- 12oz pasta (your choice of shape)
- 1 cup raw cashews (soaked 2 hours or boiled 15 min)
- 1/4 cup nutritional yeast
- 2 tbsp Miyoko's butter
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 1/2 tsp turmeric (for color)
- Salt + pepper to taste
- 3/4 cup oat milk

**Method:**
1. Cook pasta al dente
2. Blend everything else until silky smooth
3. Toss with pasta over medium heat until coated
4. Taste. Add more nooch until you're happy.

**The result:** Creamy, cheesy, slightly smoky mac that costs about $3 total and takes 15 minutes. Beats every boxed brand on this list.

**Level up:** Top with [Herbivorous Butcher](/restaurants/herbivorous-butcher) bacon bits and a drizzle of sriracha.

## The Bottom Line

Vegan mac and cheese in 2026 is genuinely good. Like, "your non-vegan roommate will steal this" good. **Goodles** wins overall, **Annie's** wins on value, and **Reverie Cafe** wins for restaurant mac in Minneapolis.

And if you really want to impress someone? Make the cashew scratch mac. It takes 15 minutes and costs $3. You'll never go back to boxed.

    content: `It had been *years* since I last ate at J. Selby's — we moved out of state and life just got in the way. But when my husband and I finally made it back, it was like no time had passed at all. Just as good as the first time.

![Nachos with pico de gallo at J. Selby's](/images/reviews/j-selbys/nachos-pico.jpg)

We went a little overboard with the order (no regrets): nachos with pico de gallo, the crunch wrap supreme, the buffalo chicken wrap, and a Caesar side salad. Every single thing was phenomenal. If you're someone who thinks vegan food can't hit like that, J. Selby's will change your mind real quick.

![Crunch wrap supreme with fries](/images/reviews/j-selbys/crunch-wrap-fries.jpg)

The crunch wrap was crispy, loaded, and honestly better than the fast food version it's inspired by. The buffalo chicken wrap had the perfect amount of heat, and the Caesar salad was fresh with a creamy dressing and big crunchy croutons.

![Caesar salad and buffalo chicken wrap](/images/reviews/j-selbys/salad-buffalo-wrap.jpg)

The staff was friendly, helpful, and genuinely great at giving recommendations — which matters when the menu has this many solid options.

The little moment that stuck with me? We ordered a cookies and cream shake to share, and they asked if we'd like it split into two separate cups. It's a tiny thing, but those small touches go a long way in my book.

![Cookies and cream shake with J. Selby's sign](/images/reviews/j-selbys/shake-sign.jpg)

**10 out of 10 experience.** I loved the food here and I will absolutely be back to work my way through the rest of the menu.

## What We Ordered

|------|---------|
| Nachos with Pico de Gallo | Huge portion, perfect for sharing. Loaded and flavorful. |
| Crunch Wrap Supreme | Crispy, satisfying, better than the original. |
| Buffalo Chicken Wrap | Great heat, packed with flavor. |
| Caesar Side Salad | Fresh greens, creamy dressing, big croutons. Delicious. |

## Fully Vegetarian Restaurants in Minneapolis

These spots serve no meat whatsoever — safe havens for vegetarians who don't want to parse ingredient lists.

### Hard Times Cafe — Punk Rock Diner Vibes

**Cedar-Riverside | $ | Cash Only | ⭐ 4.5**

Since 1992, [Hard Times Cafe](/restaurants/hard-times-cafe) has been the beating heart of Minneapolis' alternative dining scene. The hand-painted bright green facade, anarchist posters, and cash-only policy are part of the charm. The food? Genuinely great.

Everything on the menu is vegetarian, with most dishes easily made vegan.

**Must-order:**
- **Vegan Biscuits & Gravy** — The mushroom gravy is rich, thick, and "good enough to take home"
- **Helter Skelter** — Hash browns and tofu scramble, a classic
- **Big Fat Pancake** — Served all day, because every hour is breakfast hour
- **Tempeh Reuben** — "Fantastic" and filling
- **Baked goods** — Outstanding, rotating daily

---

### Seward Cafe — Worker-Owned Community Staple

**Seward | $ | ⭐ 4.6 (600+ reviews)**

A worker-owned cooperative since 1974, [Seward Cafe](/restaurants/seward-cafe) is Minneapolis' most beloved neighborhood institution. The menu is almost entirely vegetarian, with extensive vegan options marked clearly.

- **Monster Mash** (drink) — Hot apple cider, miso caramel, coconut whip

They have a lovely garden patio for summer dining and emphasize local, organic ingredients throughout. Worker-owned means the people making your food have a stake in doing it right.

---

### Modern Times Cafe — Greasy Spoon with Progressive Politics

**Powderhorn | $ | ⭐ 4.7 (400+ reviews)**

Punk cafes forever. [Modern Times Cafe](/restaurants/modern-times) has the greasy-spoon aesthetic locked down — but the food is vegetarian, the politics are on the walls, and the tempeh bacon actually slaps.

Perfect for the hungover weekend brunch, the weekday lunch, or any time you need a veggie burger and a strong coffee.

**Must-order:**
- **Tempeh Bacon BLT** — The real reason people come back
- **Veggie Burger** — "Better than I expected and I expected a lot"

### Foxy Falafel — Crispy, Fresh, Fast

## 100% Vegan Restaurants (Perfect for Vegetarians Too)

These spots serve zero animal products — which means zero cross-contamination concerns and menus that are 100% vegetarian-safe by default.

### The Herbivorous Butcher — America's First Vegan Butcher Shop

**Northeast Minneapolis | $$ | ⭐ 4.6**

[The Herbivorous Butcher](/restaurants/herbivorous-butcher) is a Minneapolis landmark. Opened in 2016 by siblings Aubry and Kale Walch, it was the first vegan butcher shop in the United States. It's also just... really good.

## Tips for Vegetarians in Minneapolis

**1. Most "vegan" restaurants are vegetarian-safe.** If a restaurant is 100% vegan, it's by definition 100% vegetarian. Cross-contamination isn't a concern, and you can order anything on the menu.

**2. "Vegan-friendly" means look before you order.** These restaurants have vegetarian options but may also serve meat. Check the menu or ask your server about preparation.

**3. The best neighborhoods for vegetarian dining are Seward and Powderhorn.** Both have high concentrations of fully vegetarian and vegan spots within walking distance of each other.

**4. Minneapolis' vegan bakery scene is underrated.** If you haven't been to [French Meadow](/restaurants/french-meadow), fix that. Our [vegan bakeries guide](/blog/vegan-bakeries-minneapolis) covers the full scene.

**5. Brunch is especially strong.** Hard Times, Seward, and Modern Times form an all-day breakfast triangle that rivals cities twice Minneapolis' size. See our full [vegan brunch guide](/blog/vegan-brunch-minneapolis) for more.

---

## The Bottom Line

Minneapolis doesn't get enough credit for its vegetarian dining scene. The city has multiple fully vegetarian and vegan restaurants in nearly every neighborhood, with food that doesn't apologize for what it is — it just tastes great.

Whether you're a committed vegetarian, flexitarian, or just curious, Minneapolis has you covered. Start with Hard Times for the biscuits and gravy. End with Reverie for a beer and the Rev Burger. Everything in between is negotiable.

## Vegan Restaurants in St. Paul, MN — 2026 Guide

St. Paul doesn't get as much attention as Minneapolis for plant-based dining, but it should. The city has a genuinely excellent spread of vegan and vegan-friendly restaurants — from one of the Twin Cities' best 100% vegan comfort food spots to a Grand Avenue corridor packed with plant-forward global cuisine. If you know where to look, you'll eat very well.

This guide covers every vegan and plant-based restaurant worth knowing in Saint Paul, organized by neighborhood.

---

## The 100% Vegan Spots

### J. Selby's — Cathedral Hill
**169 Victoria St N, Saint Paul MN 55104**

J. Selby's is the anchor of vegan dining in St. Paul — a fully vegan, all-comfort-food restaurant that would hold its own against anything in Minneapolis. The menu is unapologetically indulgent: the Selby Stack is a proper smash burger with special sauce that makes you forget you're eating plants, the mac and cheese is rich and cheesy in a way that defies explanation, and the weekend brunch menu is one of the better vegan brunch options in the Twin Cities.

Cathedral Hill is a beautiful neighborhood for a meal — walkable, historic, and close to the Grand Ave restaurant corridor. Go for dinner on a weekday when it's a little calmer, or embrace the weekend brunch crowd.

→ [View J. Selby's on the directory](/restaurants/j-selbys)

### Eureka Compass — Hamline-Midway
Eureka Compass is 100% vegan and occupies a less-obvious corner of St. Paul's dining map, but it's worth finding. The menu rotates with creative plant-based dishes that lean toward global flavors — less burger-and-fries, more intentional cooking. It's the right spot if you're craving something a little lighter and more inventive than J. Selby's comfort food.

→ [View Eureka Compass on the directory](/restaurants/eureka-compass)

---

## Grand Avenue: The Best Vegan-Friendly Corridor in St. Paul

Grand Avenue is St. Paul's most famous dining street, and for plant-based eaters, it delivers — especially for global cuisine. None of these are 100% vegan, but all have substantial vegan menus and staff who understand dietary restrictions.

### Everest on Grand — Summit-University
**No vegan dining guide to St. Paul is complete without Everest.** The Nepali and Indian menu has dozens of naturally vegan dishes — dal bhat, vegetable curries, aloo gobi, saag — prepared with the kind of care that comes from a culinary tradition that's been cooking plant-based food for centuries. The lunch thali (combination platter) is exceptional value. This is one of the best restaurants in St. Paul regardless of dietary preference.

→ [View Everest on Grand](/restaurants/everest-on-grand)

### Shish Mediterranean — Summit-University
Shish is a Grand Avenue standby with a menu built around Mediterranean staples that happen to be naturally vegan-friendly: falafel, hummus, tabbouleh, stuffed grape leaves. The falafel is freshly made and properly crispy. Ask for the vegan mezze platter if you can't decide — it's one of the best deals on the street.

→ [View Shish Mediterranean](/restaurants/shish-mediterranean)

### Khyber Pass Cafe — Summit-University
Afghan cuisine gets overlooked, and that's a shame — it's one of the most naturally vegan-friendly food traditions you'll encounter. Khyber Pass has been on Grand Ave for years with a menu of herb-forward salads, lentil dishes, and vegetable-centered mains that are miles away from generic "vegan options." The aushak (leek dumplings) can be made vegan on request.

→ [View Khyber Pass Cafe](/restaurants/khyber-pass-cafe)

### Cafe Latte — Summit-University
A St. Paul institution since 1985. Cafe Latte is cafeteria-style, bustle-filled, and reliably good for plant-based eating — soups, grain bowls, vegetable dishes, and a bakery case that always has vegan options tucked in next to the legendary layer cakes. Not a vegan restaurant, but a beloved neighborhood anchor that accommodates well.

→ [View Cafe Latte](/restaurants/cafe-latte)

---

## Frogtown & East St. Paul: Vietnamese Vegan Central

Frogtown is one of the most culinarily underrated neighborhoods in the Twin Cities. The Vietnamese restaurant density here rivals anything in the metro, and several spots have excellent vegan options.

### Ngon Vietnamese Bistro — Frogtown
Ngon means "delicious" in Vietnamese, and it delivers. The pho broth can be made with vegetable stock, and the menu has dedicated vegetarian options clearly marked. The spring rolls (gỏi cuốn) are a perfect starter. It's a step up from a typical pho shop — slightly more considered plating, better drink menu — without losing the warmth of a neighborhood Vietnamese restaurant.

→ [View Ngon Vietnamese Bistro](/restaurants/ngon-vietnamese)

### iPho by Saigon — Frogtown
For classic pho in a more traditional setting, iPho by Saigon hits the mark. The vegetable pho is a proper bowl — aromatic broth, rice noodles, fresh herb plate, bean sprouts, lime. Simple, satisfying, and affordable. The Frogtown location means you're eating in the heart of St. Paul's Vietnamese community, which is always the right move for Vietnamese food.

→ [View iPho by Saigon](/restaurants/ipho-saigon)

---

## Neighborhood Gems

### Foxy Falafel — St. Anthony Park
The name tells you everything. Foxy Falafel is a vegetarian falafel shop near the intersection of St. Paul and St. Anthony Park (the neighborhood straddling the Minneapolis-St. Paul border near the U of M). The falafel is freshly fried, the wraps are loaded, and the menu is simple in the right way. Excellent lunch spot.

→ [View Foxy Falafel](/restaurants/foxy-falafel)

### Bole Ethiopian Cuisine — Como
Ethiopian food is one of the most vegan-friendly cuisines in the world — the traditional fasting diet (tsom) is entirely plant-based, and injera with vegetable stews is a core part of Ethiopian cooking. Bole brings that tradition to Como with a warm, family-run atmosphere. Order the vegetarian combination and let the injera do the rest.

→ [View Bole Ethiopian Cuisine](/restaurants/bole-ethiopian)

### Tongue in Cheek — Payne-Phalen
Tongue in Cheek is the most upscale entry on this list — a cocktail bar with a creative small-plates menu in the Payne-Phalen neighborhood. Vegan options rotate with the seasonal menu. It's the right choice for a date night when you want something more elevated, with some of the best cocktails in St. Paul alongside vegan-friendly food.

→ [View Tongue in Cheek](/restaurants/tongue-in-cheek)

## Navigating St. Paul Neighborhoods

St. Paul's geography is more sprawling than Minneapolis, but here's how to think about it for vegan dining:

**Grand Avenue / Summit-University:** The main restaurant corridor. Walk-friendly, with Everest, Shish, Khyber Pass, and Cafe Latte all within a few blocks of each other. J. Selby's is a 10-minute walk east.

**Cathedral Hill:** J. Selby's anchors this neighborhood. Quiet and residential — great for a focused dinner destination.

**Frogtown:** Best for Vietnamese food. Ngon and iPho by Saigon are both here. The neighborhood has a strong Southeast Asian food culture that rewards exploration.

**Hamline-Midway:** Eureka Compass is here. Less obvious but worth the trip for 100% vegan dining.

**St. Anthony Park:** Foxy Falafel. A tucked-away neighborhood between Minneapolis and St. Paul, near the U of M Saint Paul campus.

**Como:** Bole Ethiopian. Near Como Park and the conservatory — pair with a walk.

---

## Tips for Vegan Dining in St. Paul

**1. Grand Avenue is your anchor.** For a vegan-friendly dining day in St. Paul, start on Grand Ave. You can walk between Everest, Shish, Khyber Pass, and Cafe Latte in 15 minutes.

**2. J. Selby's is non-negotiable if you haven't been.** It's one of the best vegan restaurants in the Twin Cities, full stop. The Cathedral Hill location is worth the drive from anywhere in the metro.

**3. Vietnamese restaurants are your best vegan-friendly bet.** Frogtown's Vietnamese spots have naturally vegan-friendly menus — just specify vegetable broth for pho.

**4. Ethnic cuisine is where St. Paul shines.** Ethiopian (Bole), Nepali/Indian (Everest), Afghan (Khyber Pass), and Vietnamese (Ngon, iPho) are all categories where St. Paul competes with or beats Minneapolis.

**5. Cross the river for Minneapolis options.** St. Paul and Minneapolis are 15 minutes apart. If you're eating in St. Paul, Minneapolis' larger vegan scene is always accessible — see our [Minneapolis vegan guide](/blog/best-vegan-restaurants-minneapolis-2026) for the full picture.

## Your Complete Guide to Vegan Food in Minneapolis

Minneapolis doesn't get enough credit for this, so I'll say it plainly: **this city has one of the best vegan food scenes in the Midwest**. Full stop.

We're talking the nation's first vegan butcher shop. Multiple 100% vegan restaurants that could compete with anything in New York or LA. A Seward neighborhood so plant-based that you can eat for three days without touching the same spot twice. Ethiopian spots, vegan smash burgers, gourmet doughnuts, injera platters, Korean-inspired bowls — all vegan or vegan-friendly, all within a few miles of each other.

This is the guide. Everything you need to know about vegan food in Minneapolis MN, organized by category, neighborhood, and how hungry you are.

## Start Here: The Icons

### The Herbivorous Butcher — Northeast Minneapolis

**⭐ 4.7 | $$ | Northeast | 100% Vegan**

[The Herbivorous Butcher](/restaurants/herbivorous-butcher) is the reason food writers put Minneapolis on their vegan radar. Founded by siblings Kale and Aubry Walch, it's a **fully vegan butcher shop** — the first of its kind in the US — selling handcrafted vegan meats, cheeses, and pantry goods that genuinely taste like the real thing.

The smoked gouda, the Italian sausage, the pepperoni, the chicken cutlets — these are not grocery store substitutes. They're the kind of products you buy, take home, and then immediately text three people about.

*"My non-vegan dad asked me to order him more of the smoked gouda. We've never been closer."*

Come for a sandwich at the shop, leave with a bag of provisions. The shop is also a James Beard Award semifinalist — just in case you needed official validation.

**Best for:** First-timers to Minneapolis vegan food, gift shopping, stocking your fridge

---

### J. Selby's — Cathedral Hill, St. Paul

**⭐ 4.7 | $$ | Cathedral Hill | 100% Vegan**

Yes, technically it's in St. Paul — but J. Selby's is essential to the Minneapolis vegan food conversation and only 15 minutes away. It's the kind of fully vegan comfort food restaurant where non-vegans bring their vegan friends thinking they're doing them a favor, then end up ordering the most food at the table.

Cauliflower wings, smash burgers, Animal Fries, a Crunchwrap that puts Taco Bell to permanent shame. A full bar with bottomless mimosas on weekends. The Herbivorous Butcher products featured throughout the menu.

See our full [J. Selby's review](/blog/j-selbys-review-saint-paul-vegan) and the [vegan restaurants St. Paul guide](/blog/vegan-restaurants-st-paul) for more.

**Best for:** Weekend brunch, group dinners, convincing skeptics that vegan food slaps

---

## Vegan Food by Category

### Comfort Food & Burgers

Minneapolis does vegan comfort food exceptionally well. A few standouts:

**[Reverie Cafe + Bar](/restaurants/reverie-cafe-bar)** (Multiple locations) — Reverie's weekend menu goes hard: loaded sandwiches, bowls, brunch plates. The menu rotates seasonally and everything is or can be made vegan. One of the most consistent spots in the city.

**[Francis Burger Joint](/restaurants/francis-burger-joint)** — Fully vegan smash burgers in a no-frills setting. The double smash with special sauce is legitimately one of the best burgers (vegan or otherwise) in Minneapolis. They know what they're doing.

**[Hard Times Cafe](/restaurants/hard-times-cafe)** (Seward) — Cash only, punk rock vibes, legendary vegan biscuits and gravy with mushroom gravy that people drive across the city for. Open late. Always a character or two at the counter.

**[Modern Times Cafe](/restaurants/modern-times)** (Powderhorn) — The hangover brunch cure. Greasy, generous portions, relaxed atmosphere, all-vegan menu. Tofu scrambles, hash browns, and coffee. Exactly what Saturday mornings are for.

→ Full guide: [Vegan Comfort Food Minneapolis](/blog/vegan-comfort-food-minneapolis)

---

### Ethiopian Food

Minneapolis has an exceptional Ethiopian food scene, and Ethiopian cuisine is one of the most naturally vegan-friendly cuisines on the planet — especially during the fasting periods when observant Ethiopian Christians eat fully vegan meals.

**[Lulu Ethiovegan](/restaurants/lulu-ethiovegan)** (South Minneapolis) — Fully vegan Ethiopian. Everything on the menu: the veggie combos, the lentil dishes, the gomen, the mushroom tibs, the injera. This is the rare restaurant that's fully vegan AND fully Ethiopian, not a compromise version of either.

**[Bole Ethiopian](/restaurants/bole-ethiopian)** (South Minneapolis) — Not fully vegan, but a large vegan-friendly menu with clearly marked options. The veggie combo is enormous and the injera is excellent.

→ Full guide: [Ethiopian Vegan Food Minneapolis](/blog/ethiopian-vegan-food-minneapolis)

---

### International Vegan Food

The international food scene in Minneapolis skews heavily vegan-friendly:

**[Foxy Falafel](/restaurants/foxy-falafel)** (NE Minneapolis) — Mediterranean-Middle Eastern with most dishes naturally vegan. The falafel wrap is the obvious order but the mezze plates are where it gets interesting.

**[Seed Cafe](/restaurants/seed-cafe)** — Fully plant-based Asian-inspired dishes. A quieter gem in a city full of loud standouts.

**[Shish Mediterranean](/restaurants/shish-mediterranean)** (St. Paul) — Mostly vegetarian with strong vegan options. The hummus, falafel, and stuffed grape leaves are highlights.

**[Namaste Cafe](/restaurants/namaste-cafe)** — South Asian flavors with a vegan-friendly menu throughout.

---

### Bakeries & Sweets

Minneapolis bakeries are increasingly all-vegan or vegan-friendly:

**[Glam Doll Donuts](/restaurants/glam-doll-donuts)** (Uptown) — 100% vegan doughnuts in surreal flavors. The Femme Fatale (lavender glaze), the Rebel Rebel (chocolate orange), the rotating specials — these are not health food and that's the point.

**[French Meadow Bakery](/restaurants/french-meadow)** (Uptown) — One of Minneapolis' oldest organic bakeries with a full vegan menu. Breads, pastries, a full breakfast/lunch/dinner menu. One of the few spots where you can get vegan eggs benedict done properly.

→ Full guide: [Vegan Bakeries Minneapolis](/blog/vegan-bakeries-minneapolis)

---

### Pizza

Minneapolis has a genuinely excellent vegan pizza scene:

**[Pizza Luce](/restaurants/pizza-luce)** (Multiple locations) — The local institution. Vegan cheese and toppings that hold up under scrutiny. The Athena (spinach, artichoke, roasted garlic) is a crowd-pleaser.

**[Pizza Karma](/restaurants/pizza-karma)** (Dinkytown) — Late night vegan-friendly pizza until 3am on weekends. Dairy-free cheese that actually melts. A lifesaver at 1am.

→ Full guides: [Vegan Pizza Minneapolis](/blog/vegan-pizza-minneapolis) | [Best Vegan Pizza Minneapolis](/blog/best-vegan-pizza-minneapolis)

---

### Brunch

Minneapolis brunch is extremely vegan-accommodating:

**[Seward Cafe](/restaurants/seward-cafe)** — Worker-owned cooperative, garden patio, tofu scrambles, biscuits and gravy, affordable prices. The quintessential Minneapolis vegan brunch.

**[Hard Times Cafe](/restaurants/hard-times-cafe)** — Late-opening, cash-only punk cafe with legendary vegan biscuits.

**[French Meadow Bakery](/restaurants/french-meadow)** — Full vegan brunch with a bar. Outdoor seating and a rare free parking lot in Uptown.

→ Full guide: [Vegan Brunch Minneapolis](/blog/vegan-brunch-minneapolis)

---

## Best Neighborhoods for Vegan Food in Minneapolis

### Seward — The Vegan Epicenter

Seward is the most organically vegan-friendly neighborhood in the city. You've got Seward Cafe (worker-owned, full vegan menu), Seward Co-op (incredible prepared foods and hot bar), Hard Times Cafe (nearby in Powderhorn), and Modern Times Cafe just south. It's also where Lulu Ethiovegan sets up shop for their weekend pop-ups.

If you only have one afternoon to eat vegan in Minneapolis, start in Seward.

### Northeast Minneapolis — Creative and Cool

Northeast has The Herbivorous Butcher (the mothership), Vegan East (fully vegan, rotating specials), Foxy Falafel, and a general neighborhood culture of independent, food-forward spots. It's a solid half-day of eating.

→ Full guide: [Northeast Minneapolis Vegan Guide](/blog/northeast-minneapolis-vegan-guide)

### Uptown — The Classics

French Meadow, Glam Doll Donuts, Crisp & Green, and a cluster of vegan-friendly spots along Hennepin and Lake. Uptown has more options per block than anywhere else in the city, though it leans more "vegan-friendly" than "fully vegan."

### Powderhorn & South Minneapolis

Modern Times, Hard Times, Lulu Ethiovegan — this stretch of South Minneapolis is where old-school Minneapolis vegan culture lives. Less trendy than NE or Uptown, more community-rooted.

---

## The Minneapolis Vegan Food Day Itinerary

Want to do a proper Minneapolis vegan food tour? Here's how to spend a day:

**Morning:** Start at **[The Herbivorous Butcher](/restaurants/herbivorous-butcher)** — coffee, a breakfast sandwich, and browse the shop. Pick up provisions for home.

**Lunch:** Head to **Seward** for lunch at **[Seward Cafe](/restaurants/seward-cafe)** — a tofu scramble if you're still in breakfast mode, or a loaded sandwich if you're ready for lunch.

**Afternoon snack:** **[Glam Doll Donuts](/restaurants/glam-doll-donuts)** in Uptown. You know why.

**Dinner:** **[Lulu Ethiovegan](/restaurants/lulu-ethiovegan)** for a full injera spread — the veggie combo feeds two people and costs about $22.

**Late night:** **[Pizza Karma](/restaurants/pizza-karma)** in Dinkytown if you're still moving. Dairy-free cheese, open until 3am Thursday–Saturday. Go.
