# Competitor Intelligence Report — mplsvegan.com
**Date:** February 17, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

The Minneapolis vegan blog/directory space is **wide open**. Of 10+ competitor sites identified, 5 are completely dead (404), 2 are severely outdated, and only 2 remain active — one of which is a global travel blog with minimal local authority. **mplsvegan.com has a massive opportunity to become the dominant local resource.**

---

## 1. Dead Competitor Sites (404 / Offline)

These sites' Minneapolis vegan content is completely gone — anyone linking to them is sending visitors to a broken page.

| Site | URL | Status | Domain Expires | Purchasable? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Roaming Vegans** | `roamingvegans.com/ultimate-twin-cities-vegan-guide` | 404 — guide deleted | Jul 2026 | ❌ Locked (GoDaddy) |
| **Wayfaring Vegan** | `wayfaringvegan.com/vegan-in-minneapolis` | 404 — page gone | Nov 2027 | ❌ Locked (Wild West) |
| **The Wanderful Me** | `thewanderfulme.com/vegan-food-minneapolis` | 404 — page deleted | Jan 2027 | ❌ Locked (Squarespace) |
| **QuestMN** | `questmn.com/vegan-restaurants-minneapolis` | 404 — page gone | Jul 2026 | ❌ Locked (Amazon) |
| **Robin Asbell** | `robinasbell.com/blog` | 403 — access blocked | Not checked | ❌ |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **None of these domains are available for purchase.** All are actively registered with transfer/delete protections. However, `roamingvegans.com` and `questmn.com` both expire in **July 2026** — worth monitoring if they lapse.

### Known Backlink References to Dead Pages
These are sites/threads that still link to the now-dead competitor pages — prime outreach targets:

| Source | Links To (Dead) | Opportunity |
|---|---|---|
| **Reddit r/vegan_travel** — "Is Minneapolis one of the most underrated US cities for vegans?" | `roamingvegans.com` Twin Cities guide | Comment with updated mplsvegan.com link |
| **Quora** — vegan-friendly cities discussion | `roamingvegans.com/vegan-states-usa` | Answer with mplsvegan.com reference |
| **Multiple Reddit threads** (cross-language) | `roamingvegans.com` Minneapolis content | Community posts referencing dead guide |

> [!TIP]
> **Broken Link Building Strategy:** Use Semrush's Backlink Analytics (or Ahrefs) to pull the full backlink profile for each dead URL. Then email each linking site: *"Hey, I noticed your page links to [dead URL] which is now a 404. We have an up-to-date Minneapolis vegan guide at mplsvegan.com that would be a great replacement."*

## 2. Severely Outdated Competitors

### veganminneapolis.wordpress.com — ☠️ Effectively Dead

![Semrush Overview — Vegan Minneapolis](/Users/jacobgiebel/.gemini/antigravity/brain/87e4fd30-0cc0-4d5d-b819-ffee1e19ac92/semrush_veganminneapolis_1771324891469.png)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Authority Score | **2** (Lacks organic presence) |
| Monthly Organic Traffic | **0** |
| Organic Keywords | **4** |
| Backlinks | **15** |
| Referring Domains | **3** |
| Last Post | **May 2017** (~9 years ago) |

**Key Issues:**
- Still lists **Ecopolitan** (closed ~2016) and **Triple Rock Social Club** (closed 2017) as recommended spots
- Zero organic traffic — Google has essentially deindexed it
- Only 15 backlinks but still appears in some Google searches for "vegan Minneapolis blog"
- WordPress.com subdomain (not even a custom domain)

**Opportunity:** The brand name "Vegan Minneapolis" still carries SEO weight. Consider creating a blog post titled "Vegan Minneapolis: The Complete 2026 Guide" to capture anyone searching for this phrase.

---

### plantbasedlivin.com — 😴 Stale / Pivoted Away

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Last Twin Cities content | ~2020-2021 (pandemic era) |
| Current content focus | Generic product reviews, DIY cleaning, lifestyle |

**Key Issues:**
- Twin Cities "Favorite City Series" blog post exists but hasn't been updated
- Blog pivoted to product reviews and generic lifestyle content
- Posts reference "pandemic depression" and generic brand spotlights
- No longer producing Twin Cities-specific vegan content

---

### onegirltwocities.com — 🔄 Pivoted Away

- Previously known as a "local vegan food blogstress" in the Twin Cities
- Now a **general lifestyle/travel blog** — no longer vegan Minneapolis focused
- Still appears in some legacy search results for Minneapolis vegan content

## 3. Active Competitors — Deep Dive

### 🥇 Bite-Sized Beet (`bitesizedbeet.com`) — Primary Local Competitor

![Semrush Overview — Bite-Sized Beet](/Users/jacobgiebel/.gemini/antigravity/brain/87e4fd30-0cc0-4d5d-b819-ffee1e19ac92/semrush_bitesizedbeet.png)

### 🥈 VeggieVisa (`veggievisa.com`) — Global Blog, Minimal Local Threat

![Semrush Overview — VeggieVisa](/Users/jacobgiebel/.gemini/antigravity/brain/87e4fd30-0cc0-4d5d-b819-ffee1e19ac92/semrush_veggievisa_1771325047034.png)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Authority Score | **32** (Good) |
| Monthly Organic Traffic | **702** (+21% trend) |
| Organic Keywords | **1,700** |
| Backlinks | **5,100** |
| Referring Domains | **1,200** |
| AI Visibility | **14** (9 mentions, 40 cited pages) |
| Run by | Randi |
| Focus | Global vegan travel (Barcelona-heavy) |

**Key Observations:**
- Higher authority (32) and backlinks (5.1K) than Bite-Sized Beet, but **lower traffic** (702 vs 2,100) — authority spread thin across many cities
- Minneapolis is just one of many city guides — not their primary focus
- Their Minneapolis page likely drives a small fraction of their total traffic
- Their strength is in vegan travel content (Barcelona, international cities)
- **Not a serious local competitor** — they don't have the depth or local knowledge

---

### HappyCow (`happycow.net`) — Category Giant

| Metric | Notes |
|---|---|
| Type | Global vegan restaurant database |
| Threat Level | Low-medium — generic listings, no editorial content |
| Advantage | Massive domain authority, user reviews |
| Weakness | No local editorial, no neighborhood guides, no blog content |

**Strategy:** Don't compete head-on. HappyCow is a database; mplsvegan.com is a curated local guide with editorial personality. Different value propositions.

## 4. Actionable Opportunities

### 🔗 Broken Link Building (Immediate)

Use Semrush Backlink Analytics to pull full backlink lists for these dead URLs:
1. `roamingvegans.com/ultimate-twin-cities-vegan-guide` 
2. `wayfaringvegan.com/vegan-in-minneapolis`
3. `thewanderfulme.com/vegan-food-minneapolis`
4. `questmn.com/vegan-restaurants-minneapolis`

**Outreach template:**
> Hi [Name], I noticed your article [title] links to [dead URL], which now returns a 404 error. We maintain an up-to-date Minneapolis vegan restaurant directory at mplsvegan.com with 169 pages covering 23 neighborhoods and multiple cuisines. Would you consider updating the link? Happy to help with any info you need!

### 📝 Content Gaps to Fill (High-Impact)

Based on what's driving traffic to competitors:

| Content Idea | Competitor Reference | Keyword Volume | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **"Best Vegan Mac and Cheese Brands Ranked"** | BSB's #1 page (25% of traffic!) | 8,100 | 🔴 High |
| **"MN State Fair Vegan Food Guide 2026"** | BSB's recurring seasonal hit | 1,000+ seasonal | 🔴 High |
| **"Best Vegan Ice Cream in the Twin Cities"** | BSB's #3 page | 390 | 🟡 Medium |
| **"Best Vegan Pizza in Minneapolis"** | BSB's #6 page | 500+ | 🟡 Medium |
| **"Best Vegan Date Night Restaurants Minneapolis"** | BSB's special occasion guide | 200+ | 🟡 Medium |
| **Individual restaurant deep-dive reviews** | BSB reviews (Hai Hai, etc.) | Varies | 🟡 Medium |
| **"Keg and Case Market Vegan Guide"** | BSB's #2 page | 1,000 | 🟢 Lower |
| **Chain restaurant vegan options** (Denny's, etc.) | BSB coverage | National volume | 🟢 Lower |

### 🏗️ Structural Advantages to Leverage

Things mplsvegan.com does better than ALL competitors:
1. **169 pages** vs BSB's 98 — more indexable content
2. **@graph JSON-LD schema** — no competitor uses structured data properly
3. **23 neighborhood pages** — no competitor has neighborhood-level granularity
4. **Cuisine-based filtering** — unique feature
5. **Dynamic OG images** — better social sharing
6. **Custom domain** — more professional than WordPress.com subdomains

### 📧 Domain Monitoring

Set calendar reminders to check if these domains lapse:
- **roamingvegans.com** — expires **July 21, 2026** (5 months away!)
- **questmn.com** — expires **July 19, 2026** (5 months away!)
- Consider using a domain backorder service (GoDaddy Auctions, NameJet, SnapNames) to auto-bid if they drop

### 📰 Newsletter/Lead Capture

Neither mplsvegan.com nor Bite-Sized Beet have a prominent email signup. **First mover advantage** — adding an email list with a lead magnet (e.g., "Free PDF: Top 25 Vegan Spots in MPLS") could build a direct audience channel competitors don't have.

```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Bottom line:** Bite-Sized Beet is your only real local competitor, and they get 25% of their traffic from a single boxed mac & cheese ranking post. Your site already has deeper local coverage. Fill the content gaps (State Fair guide, product rankings, date-night guides) and you can overtake them.
