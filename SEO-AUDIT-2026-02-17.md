# 🔍 Deep SEO Audit: mplsvegan.com
**Date:** February 17, 2026  
**Auditor:** Antigravity SEO Engine  
**Domain:** https://mplsvegan.com  
**Stack:** Next.js 16 + Vercel + Static Data (no DB)

---

## Executive Summary

mplsvegan.com has a **solid content foundation** (46+ restaurants, 9 blog posts, 20+ neighborhoods, FAQ page) but is suffering from several **critical technical SEO gaps** that are preventing Google from indexing most pages. The site has ~80+ indexable URLs but likely only a handful are indexed. The issues are fixable and the content opportunity is massive.

**Overall Grade: C+** — Good content, weak technical SEO, massive untapped potential.

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL Issues (Fix Immediately)

### 1. ❌ NO `robots.txt` File — **SEVERITY: CRITICAL**

**Finding:** `https://mplsvegan.com/robots.txt` returns **404 Not Found**.

**Impact:** Without a `robots.txt`, Google bots have no explicit guidance. While Google will crawl anyway, the missing file means:
- No sitemap reference for Google to discover
- Googlebot may waste crawl budget on `/api/`, `/demo/`, and other non-indexable routes
- Industry best practice violation that can hurt trust signals

**Fix:** Create `src/app/robots.ts` (Next.js convention):
```typescript
import { MetadataRoute } from 'next'

export default function robots(): MetadataRoute.Robots {
  return {
    rules: [
      {
        userAgent: '*',
        allow: '/',
        disallow: ['/api/', '/demo/', '/guide/download/'],
      },
    ],
    sitemap: 'https://mplsvegan.com/sitemap.xml',
  }
}
```

---

### 2. ❌ Blog Posts MISSING from Sitemap — **SEVERITY: CRITICAL**

**Finding:** The sitemap at `/sitemap.xml` contains restaurant pages and neighborhood pages, but **ZERO blog post URLs**. There are **9 blog posts** that are completely invisible to Google's sitemap crawler.

**Missing URLs:**
- `/blog/valentines-day-vegan-date-night-minneapolis-2026`
- `/blog/best-vegan-restaurants-minneapolis-2026`
- `/blog/vegan-brunch-minneapolis`
- `/blog/vegan-date-night-minneapolis`
- `/blog/northeast-minneapolis-vegan-guide`
- `/blog/ethiopian-vegan-food-minneapolis`
- `/blog/vegan-meal-prep-services-minneapolis`
- `/blog/vegan-comfort-food-minneapolis`
- `/blog/vegan-bakeries-minneapolis`

**Impact:** These are your **highest-value content pages** — long-form, keyword-rich, FAQ-loaded guides. Not having them in the sitemap is the single biggest reason for low indexing.

**Fix:** Update `src/app/sitemap.ts` to include blog posts:
```typescript
import { blogPosts } from '@/data/blog-posts';

// Add blog post pages to sitemap
const blogPages: MetadataRoute.Sitemap = blogPosts.map((post) => ({
  url: `${baseUrl}/blog/${post.slug}`,
  lastModified: new Date(post.updatedAt),
  changeFrequency: 'monthly' as const,
  priority: 0.85,
}));

return [...staticPages, ...restaurantPages, ...neighborhoodPages, ...blogPages];
```

---

### 3. ❌ Homepage Uses `'use client'` — **SEVERITY: CRITICAL**

**Finding:** `src/app/page.tsx` starts with `'use client'` making the **entire homepage a client-side rendered component**.

**Impact:** This is devastating for SEO:
- Googlebot sees a blank page initially or only partial HTML
- All restaurant listings — the core content — are rendered client-side via JavaScript
- Search engines may not execute JS fully, missing all restaurant data
- No server-rendered HTML means no indexable content in the initial page load
- Core Web Vitals suffer (larger JS bundle, slower LCP)

**Fix:** Refactor the homepage to **Server Component** with client island pattern:
- Move the filtering/search logic to a client component
- Keep the restaurant list rendering as a server component
- Pre-render the initial restaurant listing on the server

---

### 4. ❌ Missing Canonical URLs on Subpages — **SEVERITY: HIGH**

**Finding:** Only the root layout has a canonical (`canonical: '/'`). Individual pages like `/blog/[slug]`, `/restaurants/[slug]`, `/neighborhoods/[slug]` do **NOT** set canonical URLs.

**Impact:** Google may treat duplicate or similar pages as competing, diluting PageRank. Without explicit canonicals, Google guesses — and it doesn't always guess right.

**Fix:** Add `alternates.canonical` to every `generateMetadata` function:
```typescript
alternates: {
  canonical: `https://mplsvegan.com/restaurants/${restaurant.slug}`,
},
```

---

### 5. ❌ Missing OG Image & Logo Assets — **SEVERITY: HIGH**

**Finding:** The layout references `/og-image.png` and the Organization schema references `/logo.png`, but **neither file exists** in the `/public/` directory.

**Impact:**
- Social shares show no preview image (ugly on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn)
- Schema.org Organization markup has a broken logo URL → reduced trust
- OG image is a strong signal for content quality and shareability

**Fix:** Generate and add both files to `/public/`:
- `og-image.png` (1200×630px) — branded card for social shares
- `logo.png` — site logo for schema

---

## ⚠️ HIGH-Priority Issues

### 6. ⚠️ All `lastModified` Dates Are `new Date()` — SEVERITY: HIGH

**Finding:** Every sitemap entry uses `lastModified: new Date()`, meaning the date changes on every build. 

**Impact:**
- Google can't tell what actually changed — every page looks "updated" on every deploy
- Wastes crawl budget as Google re-crawls everything unnecessarily
- Violates the contract of `lastmod` — Google may start ignoring your sitemap entirely

**Fix:** Use actual content dates:
```typescript
// For restaurants, use a static date or data-driven date
lastModified: restaurant.lastVerified || new Date('2026-02-01'),

// For blog posts
lastModified: new Date(post.updatedAt),
```

---

### 7. ⚠️ No `/restaurants` Index Page — SEVERITY: HIGH

**Finding:** There's no dedicated `/restaurants/page.tsx` — the sitemap references `https://mplsvegan.com/restaurants` but this route may 404 or redirect. The app directory has `restaurants/[slug]/page.tsx` but no `restaurants/page.tsx`.

**Impact:** The `/restaurants` URL is in the sitemap with priority 0.9 (second highest!) but may not actually render a page, leading to a soft 404 from Google's perspective.

**Fix:** Create `src/app/restaurants/page.tsx` as a server-rendered restaurant directory page with full metadata.

---

### 8. ⚠️ Incomplete Breadcrumb Schema — SEVERITY: MEDIUM

**Finding:** Restaurant breadcrumbs point to `https://mplsvegan.com/#restaurants` (hash URL) instead of `/restaurants`:
```json
{ "name": "Restaurants", "item": "https://mplsvegan.com/#restaurants" }
```

**Impact:** Hash URLs are not real pages in Google's schema interpretation. This makes the breadcrumb chain technically broken — Google won't show breadcrumbs in SERPs.

**Fix:** Point to `/restaurants` once that page exists.

---

### 9. ⚠️ `ItemList` Schema Only Has 3 Items — SEVERITY: MEDIUM

**Finding:** The `localBusinessListSchema` in `layout.tsx` declares `numberOfItems: 50` but only lists 3 restaurants (Herbivorous Butcher, J. Selby's, Lulu EthioVegan).

**Impact:** Mismatch between declared count and actual items looks like thin/misleading structured data to Google. Could trigger a manual action or be ignored entirely.

**Fix:** Either dynamically generate the full list, or remove the static `ItemList` from the root layout and instead generate per-page `ItemList` schemas.

---

### 10. ⚠️ Google Search Console Verification Not Set — SEVERITY: MEDIUM

**Finding:** The `verification` field in metadata is commented out:
```typescript
verification: {
  // Add these when available
  // google: 'google-site-verification-code',
},
```

**Impact:** Without verified GSC ownership, you can't:
- Submit sitemaps
- Request indexing
- See which pages are indexed
- Diagnose crawl errors

**Fix:** Verify the site in Google Search Console and add the verification code.

## 📊 Content Audit & Opportunities

2. **Restaurant schema is comprehensive** — Includes address, geo, ratings, cuisine
3. **FAQ schema on FAQ page** — Good for featured snippets
4. **BlogPosting + FAQ schema on blog posts** — Double schema stacking
5. **Internal linking between blog posts** — Good hub-and-spoke pattern
