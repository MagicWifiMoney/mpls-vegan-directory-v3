When I  went in Heidi  was really helpful. The cake was a hit. I would get it again except try different  fillings. Thanks again  for making  my dad's day great. Also it was the Minneapolis location.",

      "text": "I'm a borderline Salty Tart evangelist. I greatly enjoy and don't mind paying for the quality of the baked goods from this place. My go-to items are the croissants (both chocolate and ham and cheese) and the brioche. I always enjoy the seasonal items (fruit and savory tarts, creme fraiche cake, anything lemon) as well. Of course the coconut macaroons are outstanding but don't overlook some of the other cookies - sour cherry, peanut butter, chocolate chip, and (been awhile since I've seen it) the salted caramel pretzel.\n\nI've converted coworkers who initially said they didn't like pastries. I've got very good reviews when I bring Salty Tart to customers, especially instead of the same old tired bagel assortment that other people bring.\n\nIf you're not familiar with all of the different kinds of pastries, the counter staff (at least in the mornings when I usually go) is very helpful in describing what everything is and steering you toward things you'll enjoy.",

      "text": "Five stars for the food - I ordered two different styles of cakes for my wedding in September and both were amazing. Guests provided great feedback and had many inquiries on where we got them. Docking 1 star though because I paid extra for delivery and asked way ahead of time if I could get it dropped off at a certain timeblock. Day of wedding, they came to drop it off 5 hours ahead of time when no one was there to receive. The delivery driver was annoyed that no one was there and had to come back at the time I requested for drop off.",
