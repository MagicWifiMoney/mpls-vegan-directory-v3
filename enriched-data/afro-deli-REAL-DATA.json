Their falafel sandwich was genuinely some of the best falafel I have ever had and their fries were undoubtedly the best fries I have ever had. The service was super quick and we got our food in under 10 minutes consistently. The staff was super friendly and the restaurant had a great atmosphere to it. Would strongly recommend if you are in the area!",

One evening, a couple of friends and I decided to have dinner there. When we went, there was a small crowd. We immediately got a table and ordered four dishes. The food came pretty soon and were plentiful. Each dish was very tasty. Also, it was unbelievably cheap. We were very happy with our meal and would gladly go back there.",

Every time I travel to MSP, I order from Afrodeli. Love the samosas, falafel and wraps. This time I tried a bowl which was also delicious.  I normally choose beef as my protein and this time I also tried a side of chicken. A little dry, but rich flavors.",

      "text": "First, amazing Chapati: Chicken 8.9, Lamb 8.1, Falafel 7.5 (flavor preferences will vary but the Chapati itself slaps). Chicken Wings, 6.5: sauce is weak and wings are meh (so hard nowadays to find even a decent wing). More important than the food, however, is that you must check your food, because they always seem to screw it up, which really, really pisses me off - enough not to come back were it not for that delicious Chicken Chapati. If they ran their ship better, it'd have been a 5-star review easy.",

      "text": "Great take-out! Portions are massive for the price point, and food is very fast.\n\nI ordered online for my first time trying the place. When I came to the location, the guy handling the orders was very fast and polite. He did seem surprised to see me tip, though. Told him I did it in cash so it couldn't get taxxed, and it was a pleasant exchange.\n\nWhen I turned to leave, though, someone immediately tried to solicit me for money. I was going to give her a few dollars too, since I know times are rough.\n\nHowever, the gyro guy somehow materialized behind me and immediately told the woman that she could not solicit money in the deli and that the kitchen would make her food. It got to the point where he was kind of guiding her gaze towards the counter so I could leave with my sandwich.\n\nI have never been in a scenario where I've seen a guy move so fast. I have further never been in a situation where a guy was that resolute after I tipped in cash. Probably gonna become a regular just for that, though. That was a crazy-nice thing to do for someone he just met, and I respect him a lot for also getting that lady food.\n\nThe sandwich itself is REAL good, though. I love a lot of tzaziki sauce on my sandwich, so the bread-to-sauce-to-meat ratio is perfect for me. I'm also small, so this was easily 2 meals for me. It's great if you don't have much money and need to eat a lot of meat. The tiramisu is also really good.\n\nThe only downside I can think of is the deli at Stadium Village is small, so plan to have 3 people in your party tops if you want to eat in-person. Worth at least one try in my book, but for me, I love it. Nothing beats a good, huge box of food made by folks who keep the world spinning with their attitudes. Hope this place remains open forever.",

But on my second visit, I opted for the chicken fantastic and steak sandwich, which were both delicious and healthier with just the right amount of spice, and not greasy. I particularly enjoyed the zucchini in the chicken fantastic.",

      "text": "I'll start with the food first. I ordered the chicken curry, chapati wrap ( it came with a  salad)  and the vegetable sambusa (Stuffed triangular flour pastry appetizer stuffed with  sautéed  onions, peppers & green chili and potatoes)\n\n. The Chicken curry perfectly seasoned with super tender chicken breast and  vegetables. It was was very good. The Chicken chapati wrap was absolutely delicious and the vegetable sambusa  was also delicious. The only thing that I didn't like about this meal was the salad wasn't that great.  The service was top notch and the prices are actually very good. I hope I'm able to come back  here again on Friday before I fly back home on Saturday. I would like to take some of the vegetables sambusas back home.",

There's usually a line during the weekday lunch rush, but it tends to move quickly. Not a great space to sit down and chat, but there are decent options to take your food to go and eat outside if the weather is nice.",

      "text": "The two types of gyros were amazing. Both meats, lamb and chicken, tasted great and seemed high quality (not that strange over-processed chicken). Would eat the gyros again in a heartbeat but will be trying the wraps and beef sandwich on my next visits after running into a old colleague of mine at the restaurant who was eating those and highly recommended them! I can’t believe it took me so long to visit this restaurant! Besides the great food, the service was great and quick, and the meal reasonably priced!",
