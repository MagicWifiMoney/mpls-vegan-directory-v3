      "text": "Delightful food options (for a vegetarian feeling oppressed by America's meat-forward culture). Honestly some of the best burgers I've ever eaten, even when compared to back when I ate cow meat. Jucy Lucy, Firecracker burger, \"chicken\" sandwich - I've never been disappointed by the food at Francis Burger Joint!",

The burger and fried chicken sandwich we got were both so flavorful and cooked to perfection! (Juicy Lucy and Hunny Dijon Chicken Sandwich) Their shoestring fries were nice and hot and salty 😋\nSeveral members of their waitstaff came over to check on us, very attentive and friendly. Plus this place has a very cool, laid back vibe. We will definitely be coming back!\nPS- get a milkshake! 😋",

      "text": "I've had good vegan burgers before so I tried one of the fried \"chicken\" sandwiches here to see if someone finally made and good one and they knocked it out of the park. By far the most chicken-like substitute I've ever had and this isn't coming from someone who hasn't had chicken in 20 years so they don't remember what it's like, I had some last week.",

And the \"Kind of a Big Dill\" cocktail was what all of the State Fair pickle drinks should aspire to be!\n\nMy husband had the barbecutie chicken sandwich and was impressed by how meat-like it was. I had the elote burger - adored every bite!\n\nThe contactless option for ordering and paying was very convenient, and we got our food super quickly.\n\nWe'll definitely be going back.",

      "text": "Francis is FANTASTIC! It is perhaps too soon to call it, but I'm willing to say they are a modern legend for vegan comfort food.\n\nI love their burgers, their chicken sandwiches, their fries, and their milkshakes. They have good cocktails too, with a handful of nice mocktails to boot.\n\nI'm especially partial to the Francis burger and the fried Classic Chicken sandwich (plus spicy mayo). They often have fun special sandwiches, though sometimes one might be too busy with fixins to have a distinct personality.\n\nThe murals and furnishing and general vibe of this place is fantastic.\n\nI go to Francis way more often than I reasonably should.",

      "text": "I am not vegan but this is probably the best vegan “chicken” sandwich I’ve tried. The seasoning was great and the texture of the “chicken” was pretty convincing as well. Fries were crispy and fresh. Service was outstanding! I also appreciate that this is a no tipping establishment (cost is built into the menu price). Would definitely return!",

      "text": "I’m neither vegan nor vegetarian, but these burgers are better than most meat burger joints i’ve been to. The chicken is not as convincing as I had been lead to believe, but the burger is all it takes for me to keep coming back.\nThe mixture of waitstaff/QR code independent ordering is sometimes bizarre, and leads to awkward bill splitting. It’s much more enjoyable in a very small group, ordering via QR code.",

Everything on the menu is plant based. Would absolutely recommend to everyone, whether vegetarian/vegan or not. Also had friendly staff and a cool vibe.",
