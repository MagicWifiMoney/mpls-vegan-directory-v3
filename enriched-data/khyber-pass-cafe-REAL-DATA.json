Having held out through the pandemic serving takeout, Emel and Masooda have reopened the dining room for dinner and it is, as always, like being welcomed into their home.\n\nThe beautiful, decor and inviting atmosphere at the Khyber Pass reflects the fact that it is a family-run restaurant serving delicious, soulful Afghani food developed from generations-old family recipes.\n\nThere are too many truly special dishes on the menu to list - the Chopan Kebab (lamb chops) are an unbelievable treat, the Daal a comfort, and the Murgh Kebab (chicken) I wish I could eat every day forever - multiple visits are required to try everything. But the Hummus - hands-down the best in town - and the chutneys go with every meal. The chutneys are magical pieces of art.\n\nThe Khyber Pass has been an important part of the Mac-Groveland neighborhood for nearly 30 years now, and with good reason. There is no warmer, more welcoming place around.",

We ordered the New Year's dish (the nat'l dish of Afghanistan) called Kabuli Pulao which was so special. Our 2yo loved it, too. We also ordered the lamb Choban Kebab which was totally tender and so good. We picked up some apricot and cherry chutneys to go with the lamb. Everything was delicious and the staff at the restaurant could not have been kinder or more lovely. We can't wait to come back!",

Their decor is nice, even if the tables are all small and a little crowded for even four people.\nHowever, their rating as a one $ restaurant should genuinely be reviewed! Maybe it was based on an old menu, but we brought five people, and shared one $10 appetizer, with no drinks at all, the teen with us was still quite hungry when we were done, and it cost almost $100. That's not one $, at $20 per person with no drinks.",

The chopan kbab was flavorful,and the murgh kbab was tender. The curry sauce are not spicy which is what I want. I definitely will order again!
