      "text": "I finally went to Crisp & Green after resisting for 1.5 years. My rationale: how can any restaurant that sounds healthy be delicious? I’m sure it has something to do with my childhood filled with tasteless “healthy” meals of bran fiber and iceberg lettuce. On Tuesday of last week, I finally entered the premises due to time constraints and the convenient proximity to my condo. I was warmly welcomed and shown the “HOW TOs” by an enthusiastic smiley staff member. The Seoul Bowl filled my stomach and spirit with unforeseen delight. I went back on Thursday to recreate the experience with a friend and was not disappointed. The mushrooms were perfectly marinated, changing the texture to a plump chew. The tofu was as good as any chicken I have ever tasted. When I asked how the tofu was prepared, I learned that it was bathed in some kind of dreamy citrusy ginger magic. The combination of the spicy bibimbap & cashew dressing harmoniously brought all of the fresh ingredients together. I loved the balance of sweet and savory in this dish (echoes of many Korean recipes), with the vegetable crunchiness punctuating the creaminess. I left satiated and with a newly formed respect for healthy food.",

Fast Food der besonderen Art.\nInteressante Zutaten,  reichhaltig und lecker.\nWir hatten 2 verschiedene Bowls, die beide frisch zubereitet wurden.\nDer einzige Nachteil ist,  dass es nur Einweggeschirr und Besteck gibt.",

      "text": "I ordered an Imagine Dragon Fruit Bowl and it was handed to me while I was still in the line. The lady in front of me was having issues with her gift card and the person working the register kept arguing with her so my smoothie bowl was melting as I stood there waiting to pay. Once I got to eat it, though, it was pretty good. I asked for strawberries instead of blueberries which was nice they let me do that. I also appreciated that the bowl was gluten free. I wish the smoothie part would have been a little more flavorful. Overall I would eat there again and order something different.",

      "text": "A pretty standard grain bowl & salad place. I know some people have had issues with portion sizes when ordering for delivery, but I’ve always eaten in person and they’ve always filled up my bowl. Even then, it’s not cheap, but the food is solid and there’s many healthy options if that’s what you’re in the market for.\n\nI’ve tried the Fiesta Bowl and the Bold Buffalo Bowl which were both solid. Nothing really to write home around here but if salad/grain bowls are your thing or you want a healthier option it’s absolutely worth a visit.",

I witnessed  some customers and door dash people being a tad bit rude (not acceptable people) and the staff remained professional at all times. Excellent job management!\nThe decoration is pretty and not busy. Plenty of light and very clean.\n\nWould benefit from a sign at the beginning of the line informing people that they don’t take cash. I see the no cash as a good way to keep employees safe and to ensure more sanitary standards. I will be coming back!",
