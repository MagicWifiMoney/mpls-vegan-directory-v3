It is clear that the food is prepared with love and attention to the details. You cannot go wrong eating at their restaurant -it is worth the trip if you are not local to their St. Paul Grand Avenue location. If you have an event to cater: a grad party, a special family gathering, an office party...do yourself a favor and call Shish. You will be complimented the entire time on \"how great the food is!\"  This is a wonderful business: provides a great product, gives to the local community, caring owners. I cannot say enough wonderful things about them! Thank you Leo and Beth!",

He was accommodating, moved tables around to fit our group, made sure our drinks were full! I’ve always had exceptional service at Shish but Noah takes the cake! 10/10 person. WE LOVED NOAH!!",

      "text": "Hubby and I was really craving Mediterranean/greek food- I went out of the way to drive to pick up our order. Road construction and parking was questionable, but I was able to find a safe spot to park during the night where I didn’t have to walk too far after scoping the area around the buildings aside from this restaurant for the first time.\n\nChicken shawarma pita and gyro pita were the BOMB!!! Love that you guys offered side salad and rice as options (keep in mind this is an extra charge)! Hubby and I really went big backing on this place and that was only our first time ordering too and we wanted to try a variety!\n\nI am so excited to order from Shish again in the next couple of months when we have our cravings to try the numerous other delicious things on the menu!  Portions were unexpectedly generous that we actually have leftover food saved for the next day (for the price I paid I feel that it’s wonderful and fair)! When I came inside to pick up our order around 8pm it dining room was booming with people at the booths! When you come to this place whether it be for lunch or for dinner (especially when the whole road in front of the restaurant is closed off for construction) and see that the place is busy at peak meal times, you KNOW it’s worth the walk to get in and order or to sit down and grab a bite to eat!\n\n10000/10 would make a take out order again or better yet we’ll try and come back to have a sit-in dining experience!",

We ordered more than enough food but people loved it so much by the end of the night it was gone because people came back for seconds thirds and fourths. Also a big plug for getting it the night before your wedding because it’s filling while still being healthy and not too heavy so it was perfect for the pre-wedding nerves :) tons of compliments that it was the best Mediterranean food people had had!\n\nPicture doesn’t show the spanakopita (a MUST try), pita bread (so good you can eat it plain) and salad!",

The owner talked me through the menu and cheerfully exclaimed he would fix any dish the way I needed it. We ended up getting two breakfast dishes to share family style. The owner was careful to hard scramble the eggs and put all the fresh feta on the side. It was a FEAST! He even gave us some Arabic coffee and read our mug for us. It was evident that love played a big role in everything he did that morning, and truly has been the highlight to my day!\n\nI highly recommend the Arabic tea and coffee.",

Having eaten for years in the Bay Ridge area of Brooklyn at various Mediterranean restaurants, we never thought we would find the same quality in the Midwest. We were wrong. If you’re looking for a friendly staff with reasonable prices and some of the best Mediterranean food you’ve ever had, try this place.",

      "text": "I have been eating here for many years, since it opened. It had a period where the owner seemed to be struggling to hire and maintain good employees. My sense now is that things have stabilized and that the quality has returned to excellent.\n\nSome things to keep in mind is that this is an order at the counter restaurant, a bit on the casual end of things. Your food may not arrive at your table at the same time as your companion—this is not a failure, but instead part of the design of the place. See this as somewhere relaxed where you can get flavorful, delicious food. Also, they can get slammed at lunchtime. If you need to get in and out quickly, it may be better for you to order takeout.",

Service was nice and fast. Atmosphere was surprisingly nice for a fast casual restaurant. Currently a bit more difficult due to road construction, but you can still access.",
