      "text": "iPho by Saigon in Saint Paul is a fantastic spot for anyone craving authentic, flavorful Vietnamese cuisine in a welcoming and relaxed atmosphere. From the moment you step inside, you’re greeted with friendly smiles and attentive service that makes you feel right at home. The cozy, casual vibe is perfect for a quick lunch, dinner with friends, or a comforting solo meal.\n\nThe menu offers a great variety of classic Vietnamese dishes, but the star of the show is, of course, their pho. The broth is rich, aromatic, and deeply satisfying — clearly simmered to perfection with traditional spices and fresh ingredients. Whether you choose the rare beef, brisket, or chicken pho, each bowl arrives steaming hot, generously portioned, and packed with flavor. The fresh herbs, bean sprouts, and lime wedges on the side allow you to customize every bite.\n\nBeyond pho, their vermicelli noodle bowls and banh mi sandwiches are equally delicious. The grilled meats are tender and flavorful, and the fresh vegetables add just the right balance. Vegetarian options are also available and thoughtfully prepared.\n\nPrices are reasonable, especially considering the quality and portion sizes. Service is consistently prompt and courteous, with staff always willing to offer recommendations or adjust spice levels to your taste.\n\nIf you’re in the Saint Paul area and looking for a go-to spot for comforting, authentic Vietnamese food, iPho by Saigon is a must-visit. It’s the kind of local gem you’ll find yourself returning to again and again.",

      "text": "The best pho in Saint Paul! The broth is so good. I would also recommend the fried rice, banh mi and vermicelli bowls. Service is fast and efficient. I got my pho within 15 minutes of sitting down. The regular size was huge! I was able to pay my check without any wait time. I highly recommend this place for a fast, affordable and most importantly delicious meal.",

      "text": "This is one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in the Twin Cities!! For the shear size to price ratio, this place is worth a visit. I personally love their phos, egg noodle soups, and spring rolls. Not only that, they serve food very fast and the quality never disappoints. If you haven't been here yet, add this to your list!",

      "text": "My family has been going here for years so I am well overdue to write this review. Best Pho in the US and also the cheapest. 🙌Great portions, the broth is light but flavorful, always super quick service, and don’t miss out on the cream cheese wontons (another of my favorite in the US!!). Affordable, friendly, quick service, we bring out of town friends here any chance we get. Thank you for staying delicious for years and years! 🙏\n\nP.s. takeout is also good but we have found you don’t get more broth if you do an XL vs a regular, but more noodles meat etc. tells you how often we go haha",

      "text": "iPho by Saigon is hands down my favorite pho spot—I’ve been coming here since I was 18! The food is always fast, fresh, and consistently incredible. As a Vietnamese person who’s been to Vietnam, I can say the flavors here are the real deal—classic and authentic Vietnamese food done right. It’s comforting, familiar, and never disappoints. A must-visit if you love Vietnamese cuisine.",

      "text": "Got the fresh spring rolls - exquisitely fresh, indeed - and the mock duck banh mi with tea for two. My dining companion got the pho with tofu, which was served in an immense portion. It's really hard to find a vegetarian banh mi. This mock duck version was very good (needs Sriracha). The service was lightning fast and the atmosphere is lively.",

      "text": "Everything here is so dang good, and reasonably priced! I feel you could just take the menu, tape it to the wall and throw a dart at it, then order whatever the dart hit and you would be extremely satisfied. But if you'd like me to be more specific the pho is outstanding. Especially when you're in the grip of a cold Minnesota winter. Additionally their bahn mi sandwiches are fantastic.",

      "text": "Great food. The spring rolls with pork were some of the best I've had, the pho was good with some minor complaints with the taste of the dumplings (we'll take the blame for that, my wife wanted to try a new type) and the cream cheese wontons were top notch. Great drink selections. Great service, very attentive staff. The dining room is clean but not overly ornate. Cost was appropriate for quality and quantity of food.",

      "text": "Kids size Pho is more than enough for myself and people I've been with, usually having leftovers too. The only thing is they don't serve it on to go orders, only when dining in. That's okay with me and they've always given me a to go cup without issue anyway, if you have to have it but can't eat in. An old housemate showed me the place saying it had the best pho on a budget a couple years ago, and since then I have done the same. The only restaurant I've been this impressed by, they deserve a top rating 💯%",
