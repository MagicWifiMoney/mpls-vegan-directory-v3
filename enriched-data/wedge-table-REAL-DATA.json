      "text": "Selection for groceries has improved. Staff and food are always lovely and I can buy almost all of my favorite groceries.\nThe little deli/cafe is good. I've had several things made for me that I just didn't like even though i had liked them other times. There can be mild quality fluctuation.  I recommend keeping it simple--the ingredients themselves are typically very,  VERY good anyway.",

      "text": "This place is convenient for the quick after work stop. I wish the variety was bit bigger and they used the space a little more completely (I mean my corner bodega has nearly floor to ceiling goods, so why can't they?). Lastly I blame the people who shop here as nearly an entire aisle is devoted to water and since my house has a tap I see no value in walking water back to my house.",

      "text": "It's a nice place. It's part grocery store/deli/bakery but also a meeting/community space. I am pretty sure that you can't bring outside food but correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nI like it because having casual community spaces is important, and it's great for meetups.\n\nThey have board games and two separate meeting rooms, one with a kitchen, in addition to general seating. Reservations for the meeting rooms might cost some cash.",

A small gas station sized selection of shelved, refrigerated & frozen foods as well as a salad bar, sandwich & hot food bar, soups, smoothies coffee beverages and more, made fresh to order! Also a large cafeteria style dining area with a small bar that serves wine & beer. Possibly organic vodka? Not sure on that.",

Full service deli and sandwich stations, kombucha on tap,to rate prepared sushi to - go, with sitting areas inside and out that make for great people watching while getting your naturganic on point. Selection is eccentric on certain items, but always good, always quality, and the staff rocks.",
