      "text": "Finally made a stop at Himalayan Restaurant during the twin cities vegan chef challenge to try this year’s dish:\n\nChili Momo\nCrispy Hemp and Shiitake momo with sautéed peppers and onion tossed in tangy and sweet chili sauce, topped with crunchy noodles\n\nI loved the momos but the noodles were not crunchy and the sauce reminded me a little of spaghettios. However, do not be discouraged because there are a lot of vegan options and the entrees we tried were great including the jackfruit tikka masala! Bring a friend and share a few things. There are plenty of vegan options. I look forward to going back when I’m in the area!",

The rest of their food is great but they need to get their shit together on the naan. It sucks because i love everything about this place butt i basically throw $6 in the trash every time i order because i cant eat the naan.",

Every time I come here I wonder why I would ever go anywhere else!? In my opinion, here you can get the best food in the Twin Cities consistently, every visit. The atmosphere is so cheerful, and the owner is always so kind and welcoming. It’s hands down my favorite restaurant, and I can’t say enough good things about this establishment!",

      "text": "This is the best tikka in the city. I've had lots of dishes from Himalayan over the years, but I always find myself coming back to their mushroom tikka masala. Back when I ate meat, their chicken and lamb tikka dishes were my go-to. But it's about the sauce; it's so flavorful and so rich. I always get garlic naan with my meal, which is pillowy and delightful.\n\nI often find myself ordering takeout from here out of convenience while out running errands, but the ambiance of the place is splendid with large pieces of hand-painted art on the walls of serene locations in Nepal and Tibet.\n\nFor anyone who is looking for Nepalese, Tibetan, or Indian food, I always highly recommend Himalayan.",

Tried Thukpa with chicken, (Tibetan-style rice noodles mixed with fresh garden vegetables in a savory broth). Excellent chicken noodle soup for the soul on a fall day!  Timely, yummy, not cheap yet a  great value.",

This restaurant is so much best as per environment, music choices while eating and the best part is - “The food reminds me of Kathmandu with typical style “\nIf anyone miss Nepal or someone from US wants to taste the best food in word but can’t travel to Nepal, you should come and check this🔥♥️",

      "text": "I looked to Reddit to find the best South Asian food in the Twin Cities area, and the most recommended was Himalayan. I got the chicken coconut curry (mild) and thought it was one of the best South Asian curry/stew dishes I’ve had! The price is pretty high for a one-meal portion. Usually when I get Indian/South Asian food I have leftovers, for a price of ~$15 per entree. I paid ~$18 for my entree at Himalayan and had no leftovers. Despite the higher than average price, I quite enjoyed my experience here and will definitely be coming back. Clean bathrooms, good music, friendly staff, and a good menu.",

      "text": "My friend who visited from out of town specifically wanted to visit here because of the thukpa, which I thought was very tasty as well, upon trying it a bit. The dishes that I ordered, I found them to be mediocre to good overall, which is why I am giving this establishment a 4 rather than a 5 rating. Regardless, I know that they serve authentic Nepali food, so I would still recommend them to people, especially visitors.\n\nThe momos were pretty good in a conventional way with the sauce included, and it was a pleasant experience consuming them. They weren't out of this world, which is not a bad thing here. I personally think maybe having 3 or 4 samosas would work better as an appetizer, and the potato and pea fillings were a bit plain, meaning underseasoned.\n\nInstead of getting goat curry as usual, I got the lamb curry this time, and it tasted pretty good in a conventional way as well. The lamb flavor along with the seasonings were there, along with the bones. Having rice with it was necessary. I thought having the extra diced tomatoes on top of the tomato curry sauce was pretty unique, but that could be because of my ignorance.\n\nAs mentioned previously, I would definitely recommend this establishment to those that are looking for authentic Nepali food. It's definitely a neighborhood gem in Minneapolis, even if I think there are areas of improvement.",

We have tried almost all the variety of momos, several different meat curries and many vegetarian dishes here, none disappointed! The naan comes fresh from the tandoor, all the food are fresh and tasty! Highly recommended for anyone looking for South Asian food!",

      "text": "My husband and I had a splendid lunch date at the Himalayan Restaurant. The seating outdoors is so beautiful and is decorated with many flowers. The atmosphere inside for lunch was quite peaceful, which is my ideal type of restaurant.\nWe ordered dumplings as an appetizer. My husband enjoyed the extra spicy sauce. I liked the sauce with tomatoes and spices.\nThe main courses are made to the spice level you prefer. The chicken tikka masala and the mixed curry were absolutely delicious. The naan was seasoned well with garlic and herbs. The white and brown rice were fluffy and cooked perfectly as well.\nWe are hoping to eat here again soon. Highly recommend!\nThank you!",
