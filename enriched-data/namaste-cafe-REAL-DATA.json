      "text": "Its awe-inspiring atmosphere, wide array of flavorful street food options, and bevy of beverages made Namaste Cafe a truly special stop for a spontaneous lunch.\n\nI was walking by on a summer afternoon and was drawn in by the relaxing jazz that was playing and the empty patio. I ordered the creamy chicken masala curry and iced spicy masala chai. Both absolutely hit the spot, especially the chai. Being the first customer of the day, I sat outside and enjoyed my lunch as I watched traffic pass by and more customers trickle in.\n\nThis is an exceptional spot to bring a small group, loved one, or close friend. It was a memorable experience. I can’t wait to stop by again, try more of their menu and explore more of what they have to offer. I was pleased to learn their ingredients are sustainably sourced and found the portions and prices very reasonable too.\n\nI will say based on my experience there is some room for improvement. Firstly, I found the creamy masala curry with chicken to be on the salty side. It could have been better balanced with sweetness and/or spices. Secondly, I was surprised by the wait time for what I thought was a simple dish. And lastly, it would be nice if they could incorporate some odorless or innocuous bug repellant on their patio as I was getting some mosquitoes biting from time to time.\n\nNevertheless, these are soft suggestions next to my admiration for Namaste Cafe’s charm and comfort. The place has been a staple of Uptown dining for years now and it’s clear to see why. ‘Namaste’ means to ‘honor the divine in you’ and I definitely left feeling taken care of.\n\nNot bad for my first time. Thank you Namaste! Hope to be back again soon.",

Making sure we had plenty of rice and even some extra raita with my to go order on the way out. Just the most thoughtful touches. They actually make their food fresh so yes, it may take awhile but I don't mind waiting. During my travels in other countries you often wait an hour for them to cook your food. Waiting for amazing food is definitely never an issue for me. 🤣 Highly recommend the creamy masala chicken, Golgappa, cauliflower peas and potatoes. Really anything on the menu you cannot go wrong with. Definitely a must visit place. ❤️",

We moved from Minneapolis to the south metro (25 minutes away) and we still choose this place for date night. We can’t find any place that makes curry  like they do. This place is so special and unique, I will always give it 5 stars. We recommend all the dishes. The chai and curry are fantastic. I have never had a bad experience. Eleanor, our server, was fabulous. She went out of her way to make us feel welcomed.\n\nI will go out of my way to get takeout from them as well. I hope this review finds you, and you get to experience fabulous dining.",

      "text": "The golgappa was a nice sour and refreshing, but definitely need to be aware that it's not everyone's forte. The garlic paratha tasted very multi-grained and was not the best by itself but worked great dipping in the curry. The chicken creamy masala curry and lamb namaste special curry were both very tasty. The namaste special curry seemed to have more of a depth to the flavor while the creamy masala curry was smoother.",

The outdoor patio spots this restaurant offers are unique and perfect! You can be outside and enjoy the fresh air, while still having some privacy to interact with your tablemates. The food is scrumptious and so are the cocktails!",

The coconut cream chai was yummy and so was my creamy masala curry with chicken spice level 3 which next time I'll do a four or five haha 😂 My wife enjoyed her food as well. I had no complaints and I will definitely come back for my second time around with my wife and child.",
