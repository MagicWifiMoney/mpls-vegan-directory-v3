      "text": "We just moved to Minneapolis, and excitedly checked out our neighborhood coffee shop!\n\nI love the concept of vegan/veg cuisine, & what I most love about veg restaurants (event thought I’m not vegetarian) is the use of color and amazing ingredients. Sadly only 1 of the three plates we ordered were colorfully appetizing (the falafel bowl). The lentil soup was delicious, but looked muted and brown like the “chicken and waffles” which visually did not live up to the pretty good flavor.\n\nUnfortunately, the service was also quite slow, despite the restaurant not being that busy midday on a random weekday— and the ordering system was confusing. Plus, the cash only policy, put a strict budget on our visit since neither of us regularly carry cash.\n\nThat said, we loved the outdoor seating space was wonderful, and the portions were very reasonable (large for the price— good value)! We’ve been back for coffee & love the unpretentious vibes.",

      "text": "WOW. GREAT.\n\nI was visiting from out of town and had a list of vegan spots to check out in Minneapolis. I went for a late breakfast here and got their vegan breakfast sandwich and a muddy water. It was SO GOOD. Perfectly seasoned, tastes were well thought out. It was so good I ended up there again a few days later. I ordered a LOT of food - I wanted to try all the items on the menu that called to me and I wanted leftovers to carry me through the next day. Everything was so great. Truly, this food is full of flavor. The staff are really nice. It's hard to pick a favorite, but the Korean bun was probably the most unique and flavor filled. Their house made vegan burger patties are excellent (it's always nice to see a vegan burger that isn't the impossible/beyond or bean burger). The space itself fits the vibe they have. I had a great time both times I went. No other vegan place in Minneapolis even came close to Hard Times Cafe.",

      "text": "My favorite establishment in the twin cities. This coffee shop / restaurant has been a staple of my existence: from when I was a college student to now as an adult with kids of my own. It offers a casual atmosphere for study/work, socializing, and playing games, and is a great place to meet people. It has also been open late at night and on holidays throughout the years. They have a fantastic, inexpensive vegetarian and vegan menu. Some highlights are the tempeh Reuben, veggie wrap, and hash browns. Anything in the bakery case is worth a stop but especially the muffins, which I longed for when I briefly lived elsewhere. Also, they make the best cup of coffee in the twin cities using French press as the default and ridiculously inexpensive too. I really can't say enough good things about this place. If you don't like it, you probably wouldn't like me.",

      "text": "Gives cool, dive bar energy in the daylight. Something about the place stands defiant to the soulless corporate franchise model of Barstucks and the like- no plastic payment, and early on a fellow customer got my attention to kindly alert me some cash had fallen out of my pocket. Just seems like the kind of behavior that is expected there rather than hoped for.\nAs for the food: Arabic coffee/ chocolate mix was complex and rich, with the perfect amount of sweetness. Thai peanut wrap with tofu was also quite flavorful and hearty, only drawback was it had a little too much sauce- really only deserves a half star off, if that. Prices were quite reasonable, especially considering the quality- what I would have spent on something comparable anywhere else I was happy to put in the tip jar. Will definitely be back!",

      "text": "It's pretty good. If you are a vegetarian, it's always nice to find a place where you can get some hearty, decently-priced, creative food, and Hard Times delivers this...sometimes. About half the times we go there, we come away with an amazing vegan version of a classic like a Reuben, Banh Mi, or Philly cheesesteak. The other half, we come away with a half-hearted wilted effort. I will say the breakfasts, especially the helter skelter, are almost always awesome. The atmosphere is a mix of diner, college dorm room, and aging hippie, all of which appeal to me, but don't expect neatness. My suggestion is that if you are veggie, it's absolutely worth going here...just - if you get something to go -  taste before you leave in case you want to ask for a remake.",

      "text": "A staple for Minneapolis veg food, and for good reason. Their prices are fair, pretty wide variety of choices, and you can tell everything is made from scratch. Some other reviews mention the staff, but I have always had fine experiences; some staff are just more outwardly friendly than others. All are respectful and the cooks are as well.\nMy favorites are the vegan biscuits and gravy (a half order is plenty! and, you can get the biscuit breakfast with the gravy which is a nice hearty meal), the Reuben, hash-browns, and their wide range of baked goods.\n\nThey have 2 single-user bathrooms which are both gender neutral.",

      "text": "It’s been surprisingly hard for me to find good vegan food in Minneapolis, but Hard Times is a gem. The vegan options are incredible, with tons of variety, all at prices that feel almost unreal by today’s standards, so I don’t mind it being cash only (there’s an ATM available if you need). We visit Minneapolis every year and this is a must-stop every single time. The vegan biscuits and gravy are my favorite, and all the baked goods I’ve had have been outstanding. Beyond the food, it’s very clear that the staff and restaurant are committed to creating a safe, welcoming space rooted in love and inclusion—while making it equally clear that hate (ICE) and harmful ideologies are absolutely not welcome. I love spending my money at a place that aligns so strongly with my values :) Can’t recommend it enough.",
