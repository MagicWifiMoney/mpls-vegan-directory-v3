      "text": "Love the outside of the store with its pretty pink facade. We found this place after visiting Children's Minneapolis for a dr visit. We were welcomed so warmly as soon as we walked in and enjoyed the vast array of unique donut flavors offered including vegan options. You can tell that the bakery and staff are very supportive of the city which is something that always makes me happy. We hemmed and hawed over a couple flavors because there were so many good options that it was tough to decide. The lovely lady that was helping us made sure that was not a problem and gave us two free donuts on top of the half dozen we ended up paying for. We loved all of the options we brought home but especially the bananaramma, the caramel apple cheesecake and the chocolate w/ salted caramel. We'll be back again in the future without a question.",

      "text": "Incredible vegan selection!! Grabbed all 7 vegan options and we really liked all of them. Only thing we found odd was how dense they were for yeast donuts. It wasn't bad, but we had some airier ones in Portland, and I think that would be nice to have here as well. The inside was cute and it wasn't busy when we were there. The people working there were nice.",

      "text": "The atmosphere of this place is certainly worth the visit alone. It's a great experience from start to finish and I couldn't seem to look away from the 50s interior paired with the vintage items, but I was captivated by the paintings.\nThe donuts had a ton of options, with a bunch of really fun flavors. I had to go with a classic to kinda get a good feel for the place before I got a fancy flavor. So strawberry it was! Which the donut itself was awesome, loved the croissant texture to it.\nThe one thing I would say about this place is the donuts are really rich. The toppings remind me more of frosting than of glaze. I hope to be back, but next time I'll certainly be grabbing a coffee to even put the sweet.\n\nOther than that the staff seemed friendly, and there were lots of vegan options. So I would recommend this place.",

A huge range of flavor profiles and good range of Vegan options.\nFun ecclectic artsy shop to match the creativeness of the product!\nGreat coffee and other beverages as well.\nLove it!  If you are in town, absolutely take a little time to check it out!",

We walked in and all three people behind the counter greeted us with smiles and “good mornings.” They were very patient with us, answered all our questions and orders. Their dirty chai is to die for, along with the strawberry donut. Will be back, much love🫶🏻",

They are particularly aware and helpful of any type of food preference or allergy, offering things like separate boxes for non-dairy or nuts etc. While I usually get mine to go, the funky, bright atmosphere inside always makes you want to stay and hang out. Thank you for being inclusive in all the ways 🍩🏳️‍🌈",

They have vegan versions, which is dope for folks with unique dietary needs.\n\nThe service and atmosphere were outstanding. The folks working are happy, kind, and funny. Making conversation and singing along while we made our tough choices. You felt welcomed instantly and left in a lighter spirit (though maybe not a lighter weight 😅).",

Highly endorse. I had the OG and the vegan donuts. Both great. Vegan donut was a little more dense, but ultimately just as good as the others.\n\nIf you’re the owner/manager/staff reading this. Great job. Thank you! The staff the morning of Mar 22 ‘25 could not have been better. Helpful, funny, thoughtful and cool! Any business would be lucky to have them.",

      "text": "Absolutely excellent client service. The donuts were BEYOND EXCELLENT. I ordered 9 dozen online on a Friday at 2pm needing them at 8am the next morning. I was hopeful but didn’t think this was reasonable for me to expect. The online ordering they have was super easy, the online payment was a breeze.  I placed the order and then was able to locate their contact info very easily on their page and sent a quick email requesting confirmation they could do this order. Within minutes I received a reply that it would be ready. GlamDoll Donuts came through after I wasted 2 hrs and 40 minutes trying to get assistance with Krispy Kreme. Obviously GlamDoll is committed to superior client service and the “donut bar” was the hit of the whole event and it exposed 150 new people to GlamDoll and your excellent client service. Thank you for saving this event.",
