In the 10+ years that I've been getting deliveries from them I have never had any issues and the food would the same amazing taste and quality as always, the delivery people are super friendly too. Huge kudos to whoever creates and prepares the food, it's pure art. Highly recommend!",

She said she’s been there for 12 years because it’s such a good place to work.\n\nI was visiting from out of town, first time to Minneapolis. This place came recommended by the hotel staff and I am so grateful.",

Mustard tasted like something was missing, but was still delicious.\n\nThe bartender taking care of us provided excellent service.\n\nWe are in town for 5 days and we will be making sure we visit at least once more while here.",

It had a lot of selections for food, drinks and a full bar.\n\nThe pizza was better than most I've had in the area.\n\nI highly recommend stopping by if your staying downtown near the twins stadium and looking for a good place to finish off the night with a bite to eat and a closing time drink with your friends before you call it a night!",

The cocktails were great, the seating comfy, and the service was attentive and had us laughing with all the great humor. Great vibe.",

      "text": "Pizza Luce was highly recommended. I would say overall, it was okay. The Spinach Artichoke Dip was good, but a little on the salty side. We ordered the Classic Pizza and it was good. Loved the crust.\n\nOur server was just meh. I asked for recommendations on a local beer and he asked which ones on the menu I wanted. He couldn’t give a good recommendation. He was also slow. We had to track him down to get our check and again to pay. He only had 2 tables of people to serve.",

We loved it so much, my daughter ordered another round! We had slices of yummy pizza  too. The cute place had a fabulous selection of beers on tap, I ordered a couple Guinness. Our bartender was awesome, didn't catch his name but thought someone called him Wylie.  We would love to come back when we are in the city next visit",

      "text": "Loved the Moscow Mule made with Du Nord Foundation Vodka - it was bright and refreshing, the perfect sidekick to a classic cheese pizza. Our bartender, Alex, nailed it—friendly, fast, and made sure we had everything we needed. And to top it all off? The Espresso Martini made with Du Nord’s Café Frieda Coffee Liqueur, finished with a touch of chocolate—the perfect dessert drink! Cheers to Pizza Lucé for showing love to Du Nord Social Spirits! As a proud member of Team Du Nord, I’ll always raise a glass to this awesome partnership!",

      "text": "Emily . Every time I come in, she makes the place feel welcoming in a way that’s rare these days. She greets me with a real smile, remembers faces, and treats people like they matter—not just like another order. Her positive energy honestly changes the whole experience, and it’s the reason I keep coming back. You can tell she takes pride in what she does, and it doesn’t go unnoticed. She’s a huge asset to this place. Thank you Emily.",
