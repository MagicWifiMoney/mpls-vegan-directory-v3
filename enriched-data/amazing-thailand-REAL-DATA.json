I took takeout for my partner and he loved his food as well.\nThey have a wide variety of options and most dishes can be made with your preferred protein.  Their level 5 could be a little hotter for me, but it is still delicious!! The flavors are wonderful.",

I love it.\nRecently I feel they give you less food and another thing that disappointed me was they took out my favorite dish ; before I could have  all the proteins in one meal but now just one and when I asked for extra protein they can’t cook it all together 😩",

      "text": "I do love Amazing Thailand! I always get good food and good service here, and it has nice vibes.\n\nFood is definitely on the expensive side, but you get a lot of food. I always get at least 2 meals out of my order. Their takeout orders move pretty fast too, and staff is pretty good about checking in but not too often. Drinks are unfortunately way too sweet, but the food makes it worth it.\n\nParking is not great, but you can usually find paid parking on 31st or free parking on the side streets nearby (such as Girard)",

      "text": "The food was delicious per usual.  Although, I was slightly disappointed with the Pineapple Fried Rice as there were almost no pineapple.  In addition, the cream cheese wontons were not spectacular this time around as there was very little cream cheese and the remainder of the wontons were difficult to bite into and were too chewy.  Overall, Amazing Thailand did not disappoint!  The Pineapple Fried Rice and the Druken Noodle were excellent and delicious despite the pineapple shortage. Also, the portions are very generous.  The service was excellent and the food was prepared in a timely fashion.",

      "text": "It broke my heart to see this place so quiet.\n\nI remember when Amazing Thailand was packed — filled with energy, laughter, and the comforting aroma of curry and spice. Today, during what used to be a bustling happy hour, there were only two tables occupied. It felt surreal at 4:30 pm\n\nAnd yet, the food? Still exceptional. Every dish was perfectly balanced — bold, fragrant, and full of soul. The flavors were just as I remembered: authentic, rich, and made with care.\n\nThe staff was kind and attentive, even in the quiet. They deserve a full house.\n\nIt’s disheartening to see what’s happened to Uptown — to see restaurants like this still showing up with quality while the city around them slips away.\n\nSupport this gem. It’s more than a meal — it’s a memory, a cultural anchor, and a sign of what still can be if we care enough to show up.",

      "text": "We recently visited Amazing Thailand and had mixed feelings about the experience. I asked for a recommendation and was given the Thai fried rice. Unfortunately, it did not stand out and felt like a pretty basic dish, nothing exceptional or memorable. My husband ordered the Amazing Curry with a spice level of 5 out of 5, but it was not as spicy as expected. He thought it tasted good overall though. On the plus side, the outdoor seating area is very nice and made for a pleasant atmosphere.",

Incredible service, we had paused going here for a bit as it always felt a little subpar for the price but this past time going was phenomenal and we will be back regularly. Kudos!",
